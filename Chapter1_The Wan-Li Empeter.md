THE WAN-LI EMPEROR
Really, nothing of great significance happened in 1587, the Year of the Pig. China was not facing a foreign invasion, nor was the country engulfed in a civil war. Even though the capital district did not have sufficient rain during the summer and epidemics broke out in those months, and though drought was reported in Shantung, and flood in South Chihli, and earthquakes took place in Shansi in the autumn, none of these disasters occurred in alarming proportions. For an empire as immense as ours, such minor incidents and setbacks can only be expected. On the whole, the Year of the Pig would go down in history as an indifferent one.
Can we therefore omit that year from history books?
Not quite.
During the year preceding the defeat of the Armada in the Western world，many seemingly unimportant events took place in China that were closely linked to both her past and her future. At the time it was hard to say for certain whether any isolated incident was merely a passing episode or a crucial turning point, but in fact these interlinking events made history. Moreover, it is precisely those commonplace occurrences which historians have been inclined to overlook that often reflected the true character of our empire.
Let me begin my account with what happened on March 2, 1587, an ordinary working day.
It was a sunny day. The trees in Peking were still leafless. The ground on the unpaved streets, after intermittent snow in past months, remained frozen. The air was not terribly cold, but it was not yet warm enough to make outdoor work comfortable.
Around lunchtime hundreds of governmental functionaries, civil officials as well as army officers on duty with the capital garrison, raced toward the imperial palace. Word had spread that the emperor was to meet his court at noon. The message caught everyone unprepared. The privileged few riding in sedan chairs still had time to tidy their belts and robes during the journey; but the majority, on foot, were too exhausted from the one-  
mile dash between their ofHces and the palace to pay attention to such details.
It was unclear how the guards at the Gate of Greater Brilliance came to allow the crowds to enter. Perhaps seeing the swarms of silk-robed officials, they too were convinced that an important state function was at hand. But once past the gate，the crowd entered the Imperial City.办 then they must have realized that the courtyard was too quiet for the occasion. No preparations seemed to have been made on and below the towers of the Meridian Gate. The imperial furniture was not on display. There was no bell-ringing or drum-beating. There were not even any extra guards and officials to serve as marshals. Could all this be a mistake?
Apparently someone made an inquiry of the palace eunuchs inside. It was confirmed that indeed the emperor had never ordered the audience. The crowd began to disperse, relieved yet still excited. They could not help spending a good part of that afternoon and evening discussing the ridiculous false summons; but no one could explain why he himself had been so credulous.1
The emperor may have found this little disturbance not at all unamusing. But as sovereign he had to take serious action. Soon his verbal orders were passed to the eunuchs on duty, committed to writing, and directed to the Ministry of Rites and the Court of State Ceremonial. These two offices were in charge of ritualistic proceedings, the former for designing them to conform with the cosmic spirit and historical precedents, and the latter for actual coordination. They should have known that an imperial audience had not been held at noon for 160 years and that there was no existing procedural code for it. How could the session have been called for without either preparation or rehearsal? When the rumor of the audience was circulated, members of these two offices should have helped to clarify the situation and stopped the stampede. For their failure to do so, all of them were to forfeit their salaries for two months. Moreover，an investigation was to be conducted promptly to find out who had first circulated the false message.
The investigation turned out to be inconclusive. The court reported that the whole thing had started with a large number of people simultaneously running toward the palace; it was therefore impossible to pin down the responsibility. Upon receiving this report, the emperor extended the suspension of salary to all governmental functionaries in the capital.
How severe this punishment was might not have been fully realized by the emperor. He had suspended salaries before to penalize officials for dereliction of duty and for submitting irritating memorials to the throne, but such a measure had been applied only to individuals. The group penalty covering the entire body of capital officials was unprecedented. Indeed, because emoluments for the bureaucracy authorized by the dynasty were fixed at very low levels, many officials, especially those in the higher echelons, did not live on their regular pay. A minister, rank 2a, was entitled to an annual salary of 152 ounces of silver; in practice he might receive cash gifts from provincial governors of ten times that amount on a single occasion. Aware of this custom, the emperor may have imagined that all officials received such perquisites. There was no evidence that he understood the difficulties of the office-holders in the lower ranks, who extended their personal resources to accumulate seniority and wait for provincial assignments, meanwhile often languishing in debt. For a secretary in a ministry, rank 6a, the annual compensation of thirty-five ounces of silver had to be counted as an essential item in the household budget, even though it might not pay the rent. So the harsh punishment must have brought distress to many such households.2
The action taken by the throne was nevertheless considered to be just and final. With all its pomp and grandeur, the imperial court was supposed to preserve its impeccable and meticulous manners as an inspiration to the nation. It was absolutely unbecoming for the entire court to run chaotically toward a wrong destination at a wrong time. Both the sovereign and his bureaucrats realized that to fulfill their functions they had to do well in two areas: personnel management and ceremonial procedure. Of course, not many practical problems could be solved this way, but it was essential to managing an immense empire from one center. There was a limit to the number of practical problems that could be perceived, understood, analyzed, and discharged by our literary bureaucracy that governed many millions of peasants. So discipline and decorum had to be emphasized; the example set by the emperor’s court became paramount. Rewards and punishments remained effective means to underline this emphasis.
The Wan-li emperor, now turning twenty-four, was himself a veteran of ceremonial proceedings. By March 1587 he had been the Son of Heaven for almost fifteen years. Even before his enthronement, when not yet nine years old, he had gone through the ritual of capping, which prematurely ushered in his manhood. Thereafter he was no longer considered a child, at least not in public.
Wan-li still remembered that winter day when he was led into a screened cubicle temporarily erected in the courtyard, from which he emerged three times, always clad in a new set of garments. Each time he was crowned with a different hat. The assortment of headgear and robes was the regalia designated for various ceremonial functions into which he, as heir apparent, must be initiated. Between the changes in wardrobe, he was instructed to kneel down, stand up, turn around, hold a scepter, and drink wine from a special cup—all to the accompaniment of music and the chanting of ceremonial officials. The proceedings took the whole morning. The next day the boy sat stiffly to receive the formal congratulations of the court officials.3
Several months later came the death of his father, the Lung-ch'ing emperor. As heir designate he met the imperial court in mourning. The assembly of officials had prepared polished pieces of literature declaiming the urgent reasons why he must now take over the vacant throne. Twice Wan-li, who had been carefully coached, declined on the ground that he was too grief-stricken. Only to the third round of persuasion did he give his assent. From that moment on ceremonies became inseparable from his life.
During the past fifteen years the emperor had sacrificed to heaven and earth, performed ritual motions of farming, and celebrated New Year’s Day and the ferry boat festival that fell on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. He had sacrificed to imperial mausoleums and the family temple and meticulously observed the birthdays and dates of death of all preceding emperors and empresses of the dynasty. He received missions from foreign tributaries and retiring officials who bade him farewell. He reviewed troops, issued battle banners, and accepted prisoners of war after the imperial army^ major and minor battles.
The disposal of war prisoners was usually one of the most awe-inspiring occasions of the emperor's court. He sat on the tower atop the Meridian Gate overlooking the granite-paved courtyard，flanked by general officers who held noble titles. Lined up next to them was a full battalion of imperial guards, soldiers of gigantic stature clad in shiny armor and helmets adorned with red tassels. Down below, while thousands of court ofYlcials and soldiers watched, the prisoners, in chains and red cloth with holes cut out for their necks, were forced to kneel on the stone pavement. Then the minister of justice came forward to read aloud a list of the crimes those prisoners had committed against humanity. Upon completion of the charges, he petitioned the emperor that the prisoners be executed in the marketplace. The reply from the throne—“Take them there; be it so ordered’’一could not have been heard by all present. The order, however， was repeated by the two nobles standing immediately next to the sovereign and then echoed in succession by four, eight, sixteen, and thirty-two guardsmen, until it touched off a thundering shout of the same order by the entire battalion of soldiers, their chests inflated.4
Every year，in the eleventh lunar month，the emperor received the following year5s calendar and proclaimed it to the populace, so that they would know when to plant their seeds for food and when to sweep their family graves. With the same degree of solemnity he received all important literary works compiled by the Han-lin Academy. Every work accepted by the throne was made official writ. It was placed on a portable lectern and carried through all the ceremonial gates and the entire length of the courtyard, accompanied by academicians and musicians and escorted by porters who carried burning incense.5
With full formality，the emperor granted princely ranks to his cousins and remote relatives, authorized their weddings, and bestowed honors upon their wives. He had, upon his succession, named his principal mother, the former empress, the August Empress Dowager Jen-sheng, and his natural mother, formerly the imperial consort，the August Empress Dowager Tz’u-sheng. The latter was particularly important to him, perhaps the only person in the world who had given him the kind of love due to a child.6 Many years later, on her birthday in the eleventh lunar month, he still went to the Imperial Polar Gate to accept the good wishes of his courtiers on her behalf，even though by that time he had discontinued many ceremonial proceedings.
But ever since his capping Wan-li had become a public personality. When he constructed a palace building for her，the dowager’s appreciation was not expressed orally but was incorporated into a letter of thanks solemnly read to him while he lay prostrate on the ground. The letter was then kept in an imperial archive as a state paper. When Wan-li entertained his two mothers with stage plays by a palace troupe, he had to kneel in the courtyard awaiting their arrival, rising only when the empresses dowager had dismounted from their sedan chairs.
Thus, in becoming emperor, Wan-li lost much of his personal identity and had little private life. Even when he moved about inside the palace compound, he was accompanied by a large retinue led by eunuchs who cleared the path with whips.
When he decided to elevate his favorite concubine，Lady Cheng，to the position of imperial consort, the proceedings were announced beforehand so that the ceremony might be prepared. This act caused a supervising secretary to protest on the ground that the honor should go to Lady Wang， who had given birth to the emperors first son, whereas Lady Cheng was the mother of only his third son. This objection started a controversy that was to alienate the monarch from his court and rock the dynasty for the rest of its duration. At the time, however, the ceremony proceeded as planned. The sovereign did not personally hand out the honor. As tradition prescribed, he commissioned his deputies to do so. With credential and patent they conferred the title upon the designated woman. The emperor sanctified the first haircuts of his infant sons and ritualistically gave them their names.
In performing these functions the Wan-li emperor found that he had to change clothes often, sometimes several times a day. Ming emperors wore no metal crowns. The most formal hat worn by the sovereign was a rectangular black mortarboard，with the shorter edges facing front and rear. Dangling from each of the two edges were twelve strings of beads. The curtainlike beads in front of his eyes and behind the nape of his neck must have made the wearer uncomfortable, compelling him to remain solemn and steady and to move very deliberately. To match the mortarboard the emperor wore a black jacket and a yellow skirt, both elaborately embroidered. Over the skirt was an apronlike knitted band. Along with two tassels, the band was hung on a jade belt. Red socks and red ankle-boots completed his attire.
Garments of the second degree of formality were red; they could be considered the emperor’s militaiy uniform. The headgear was a shell-like helmet, complete with chin strings in accordance with military tradition. But in place of the metal studs on the headpieces worn by soldiers, the emperor’s red helmet was lined with leather and decorated with rows of jewels. The yellow dragon robe that was conventionally regarded as the emperor’s standard costume, because he wore it so often，was in fact for occasions of even lesser degrees of formality. When retiring from public functions, the emperor changed into a black dragon robe with green borders.
The symbolic value of the office of the monarchy was amply illustrated by the ritualistic farming performed by the emperor every spring in front of the Altar of Earth. About two hundred farmers were called in from the two counties surrounding Peking to form an assembly. Actors dressed up as deities of wind, clouds, thunder, and rain. Two officials led an ox; two older farmers held a plow. Other peasants carried farm implements and barrels for human fertilizer. The emperor, however, touched neither the tools nor the draft animal. His left hand holding a whip and his right hand a ceremonial plow carved with a dragon and painted in gold, he was flanked by two elders. The procession marched across the field three times. Then the ruler retired to the tent to watch his courtiers, led by the minister of revenue, repeat the process. Seeding was performed by the prefect of
Shun-t’ien and his staff. No sooner was the soil covered than actors in peasant clothing presented five principal grains to the emperor, simulating a good harvest. The sovereign was then congratulated by all present.7
Most other state functions were less interesting; they could be very tiresome indeed. The daily audience with the court, for instance， was loathed even by the most diligent statesmen. It was a chore that several predecessors of the present emperor had found unbearable. Although now much simplified，the procedure still remained a heavy burden on Wan-li.
In order to attend the audience, even before daybreak all civil officials and all army officers in the capital and the members of the local government within the metropolitan district had gathered outside the palace. The gates were opened after drum-beating and bell-ringing. The participants assembled in the courtyard in front of the ceremonial hall. Civil officials faced west; military officers faced east. Four imperial historians were posted around the emperor to record the proceedings. Censors acting as marshals took the roll and wrote down the names of those who coughed, spat, stumbled, or dropped their ceremonial tablets. Whips were cracked to call the ceremony to order. At the chanting of the master of ceremonies, the assembly turned around, bowed to the emperor once, and kowtowed three times. The chief minister of State Ceremonials announced the names of those officials who were about to leave the capital for retirement and provincial assignments; these dignitaries then paid the sovereign special homage in farewell. Then officials ranked 4b and above filed into the ceremonial hall. The various departments and ministries made reports to the emperor; at times he asked questions and gave oral instructions. All proceedings were expected to be completed before dawn.
In the early years of the dynasty the court audience was repeated at noon and in the evening. There were 185 kinds of official business that could and must be reported to the emperor in person. Until the end of the fifteenth century at least, the morning audience had been very seriously regarded. When the sixth emperor，Cheng-t’ung，ascended the throne at the age of nine, a new rule was put into effect to limit the oral report to eight items of business a day，those having been brought to His Majesty’s attention in advance in writing. But the audience was never postponed because of rain or snow. On those days officials were permitted to wear raincoats over their silk robes. A regulation of 1477 further permitted umbrella-carriers to accompany officials to the courtyard. Only very rarely were senior statesmen, men over seventy years old, excused from attendance. Even emperors could not easily excuse themselves from the daily event. Once in 1498 the ninth emperor, Hung-chih, virtually begged his senior grand-secretary to call off the morning audience at the last minute for just one day. The night before there had been a palace fire; because of loss of sleep the sovereign did not feel physically fit to go through the proceedings. The morning audience was suspended only from one to three days upon the death of a relative of the emperor or an important statesman. Even then, while the emperor temporarily absented himself, the court officials were still required to proceed to the Meridian Gate to bow to the throne. During the period of state mourning the emperor and his court changed into somber- colored robes for the ceremony, omitting the gold and silver and ivory dress belts.8
The first to break with this tradition was Cheng-te, the tenth Ming emperor and the present emperors granduncle. Conscious of his ability to assert himself, Cheng-te was determined to carry out his own concept of monarchy rather than that of his courtiers. After 1517 he frequently absented himself from the capital for prolonged periods. As the bureaucrats refused to cooperate, he gathered around himself a staff of eunuchs. During his absences the office of the grand-secretaiy was maintained by him mainly as a center for transmitting messages, and he made little use of civil officials for decision-making. When he returned to Peking he put forth many bizarre proposals, such as that court audiences be held late at night followed by state banquets. Such suggestions seemed to the bureaucracy merely provocative.
It would be difficult to imagine what would have happened had these conditions continued, but Cheng-te died without issue in 1521. He was succeeded by the Wan-li emperor’s grandfather, the Chia-ching emperor. The succession marked the first time in the dynasty’s history that a prince from a lateral branch of the imperial family had ascended the throne. The courtiers took advantage of the opportunity to terminate the influence of the eunuchs; the most notorious ones were put to death. For about twenty years Chia-ching attended to his office conscientiously; he even instituted many revisions in court rituals，which he considered to be closer to the classical model. But when approaching middle age, he grew tired of public life. Withdrawing to a villa inside the Imperial City, he became infatuated with Taoist formulas for manufacturing elixirs. Another twenty years passed and the court audience was virtually abandoned. Unfortunately for the dynasty, Chia-ching^s reign was the longest until that of the present emperor; it lasted almost forty-five years.
The Wan-li emperor's father, Lung-ch^ng, left a colorless record in history. He ruled for less than six years. For the first year after his enthronement the morning audience was held regularly. But the emperor merely sat there, cold and numb. Even the routine utterances were made by his grand-secretaries on his behalf. Then, in the next four and a half years, even this lifeless performance was suspended, or held very sporadically.9
In 1572, at the accession of the present emperor Wan-li, Grand-Secretary Chang Chü-cheng arranged to have the morning audience with the court held on the third, sixth, and ninth days of every ten-day cycle; other days the young emperor devoted to his schooling.10 Now, almost fifteen years later, the routines had not been completely abandoned, but the cancellation of both the morning ceremony and the study sessions had been more frequent in past months. The offering of a sacrifice was usually presided overby appointed representatives. Under these conditions the false alert for an audience at noon sounded even more ridiculous.
The morning audience held by the Wan-li emperor was in fact an abridged form. Very rarely did the court move into the ceremonial hall. Except for special occasions it avoided even the Meridian Gate. The proceedings took place at the Gate of Brightening Administration because of its unpretentious surroundings and simple effect. The horses and elephants that usually manifested imperial grandeur were absent. The oral report by officials was no more than a formality. Among the items of business submitted in advance to the emperor, only those issues requiring public attention were selectively presented.
Ever since his enthronement the Wan-li emperor had impressed his courtiers with his majestic countenance. His voice was deep, his pronouncements clear and loud, ending in powerful tones which t(seemingly came from his diaphragm.” More than once this had been cited as an invaluable asset for the occupant of the throne, especially when he was a child emperor.11 Anyone could see that Wan-li was precocious. Some years later he himself disclosed that at the age of five by Chinese count—which put his actual age between three and four—he had already learned to read.12
In the early years of his reign, when he was instructed to refer to a slip of paper on his sleeve that reminded him how to respond to various requests and proposals, Wan-li had only a vague idea of what he was doing. He knew that he had to do these things because he was emperor; and for the same reason nearly everyone had to kowtow to him. In his world he had yet to meet an equal. He liked his brother Prince Lu, but the child was five years younger than he. Beyond that, there was not even a playmate at court except for a handful of eunuch attendants. Two pefsons he had learned to respect: Tutor Chang and Big Companion Feng. Both seemed to be good men, well regarded even by Empress Dowager Tz’u-sheng. Their conjunction with Wan-li's life was an act of destiny bound deeply to affect a nation of many millions.
Chang Chü-cheng, with his wide-set eyebrows and long beard, was always a source of authority and wisdom. Always well-groomed, he seemed to wear a new robe every day, with its creases well kept.13 His mind was just as sharp and meticulous as his clothing and manners. Whenever he said somethingitalwayshitthemark—clear，deflnite，andincisive.
The Wan-li emperor and his two dowager mothers had a particular reason to feel grateful to Tutor Chang, whom Wan-li sometimes referred to as the “Senior Counsellor.” When the Lung-ch，ing emperor died, the first grand-secretaiy had been Kao Kung. Having handled public affairs for Lung-ch'ing for some time, Kao took it for granted that he was still in command. He was overbearing enough that the first time he was approached by the emperor's messenger he questioned in public how a nine- year-old could actually assume that he was master. If Kao Kung were allowed to behave so arrogantly, what else would he be capable of? And if the Son of Heaven was treated by him like any other nine-year-old, did he have any respect for the two empresses dowager? It was under Chang Chü-cheng's confidential advice that the problem was quickly dealt with and solved for good. On that summer day of 1572, all officials were called to assemble in front of the palace at short notice. A eunuch arrived with a piece of yellow paper signed by the two empresses dowager and the emperor. When it was read in front of the kneeling officials, Kao Kung was shaken and lost countenance. The imperial order stripped him of his rank and position, and commanded him to return to his home region that very day. Thereafter he was to remain under the surveillance of the magistrate of the district for life. Thus, the imperial family felt that Tutor Chang had secured the throne for the young emperor at a difficult time. With Kao Kung dismissed, Change succession became a matter of course; he had more than earned the position of first grand-secretaiy.
But in addition to being the chief counsellor, Chang Chü-cheng was also in charge of the emperors education. Wan-li's five lecturers, two calligraphy instructors, and one academician attendant were all appointed by him. Tutor Chang supervised their instruction personally, sometimes took over the lecture himself, and supplemented the textbooks with his own writings.
Ever since the autumn of 1572, Wan-lfs schoolday had consisted of three separate periods devoted to basic Confucian classics, calligraphy, and history. During the rest period he retired to his lounge and the instructors to theirs within the same building. Between the first and second periods, however, Big Companion Feng Pao and other eunuchs would bring to the throne the day’s memorials awaiting the emperor’s approval, with attached rescripts already drafted by the grand-secretaries. During that hour, Wan-li exercised his sovereign right by wielding a vermilion brush on the state papers, always assisted by a half-dozen eunuchs under Feng Pao?s direction; all civil officials, including even Tutor Chang, had to stay away unless called for questioning.14
The emperor completed his studies and the day’s work at noon. He ate his lunch in the library and had the afternoon free, except that he must further practice his handwriting in his spare time, and learn the verses in the classics and the dates, names, and events in history by heart. These lessons Wan-li never took lightly because he knew that the next morning Tutor Chang might ask for a recitation. If the emperor had prepared his lessons well，the grand-secretary was ready to kneel and murmur that the dynasty was blessed to have such an enlightened sovereign; but he was equally capable of casting a pair of fiercely inquisitive eyes on the lonely and helpless pupil if he had not.
Until his wedding in 1578, Wan-li had shared his palace quarters with Empress Dowager Tz’u-sheng. She was veiy much involved in her son’s duties and functions as emperor. On the days he was supposed to meet his court, it was she who woke him in the morning. His conduct and education were always important to her. Feng Pao, the eunuch who had taken care of her son for many years, remained her contact outside the palace. As a young prince Wan-li had ridden on Feng's shoulders and started calling him “Big Companion•” Now promoted to Director of Ceremonies，Feng was the head of the palace staff. His direct access to the empress dowager transformed Wan-lfs affection for him into awe, as a bad report from him could prompt TzJu-sheng to order him, even as emperor, to kneel for long periods of time.15
Under such strict discipline and guidance Wan-li progressed well with his studies. He had learned that the primary duties of the ruler were to venerate heaven and to follow the precedents established by his ancestors. Less than four months after his accession, a supernova later known as “Anno 1572” suddenly appeared in the sky，the size of a saucer and orange in color.16 Before it dimmed its light in early 1573 and vanished a year later, the heaven-sent portent made a strong impression on Wan-li. On the advice of Tutor Chang, he fully examined himself for bad thoughts, speech, and conduct. Since even the regularity of the universe depended upon the young emperors character and wisdom, he had no choice but to be thrifty, diligent, sincere, and courteous on all occasions.
The children’s game that Wan-li played with eunuch attendants was regarded as unbecoming for the emperor; thus any crowd had to disperse at the approach of the footsteps of the Big Companion. Now the emperor had developed an intense interest in calligraphy, which was also the favorite hobby of Mother Tzsu-sheng and of Feng Pao. In early 1574, barely ten, Wan-li was able to execute characters one foot high. On several occasions he asked Tutor Chang and other grand-secretaries to watch him work with the brush and gave them his long sheets of artistry as souvenirs. Chang Chü-cheng accepted his with thanks; but the next day he came to admonish the young emperor to the effect that His Majesty’s brushwork had already exceeded expectation. Calligraphy, he further argued, was after all a minor art which in itself added nothing to the empire's well-being. Sage rulers in Chinese history excelled only in virtue，not in aesthetic skills. One should keep in mind that Ch^ng-ti of Han, Yiian-ti of Liang, Hou-chu of Ch5en, Yang-ti of Sui, and Hui-tsung of Sung were accomplished musicians, painters，poets，and writers. Yet, with all their talents，none of them escaped dynastic decadence and tragic ends. The moral of this lecture was that even harmless hobbies could develop into undesirable distractions that sent rulers to their ruin. To stress this point, by the end of 1578 Chang had eliminated calligraphy from Wan-li's curriculum.17
The practice of frugality started with palace expenditure. At Tutor Change suggestion, the lantern decorations and fireworks that had illuminated the imperial gardens and buildings after every new year over the past century were discontinued. The emperor had ordered the redecoration of two palace buildings as the new living quarters of his two mothers. The order was rescinded because of Chang Chü-cheng, who decided that the conditions of the two buildings were good enough as they were. At one time Wan-li complained that numerous palace women around him all loved self-adornment and he did not have enough jewels to give them. The grand-secretary urged him to think first of food and clothing for the populace: emperors should never be preoccupied with pearls and precious stones，as they can in no way dispel cold and hunger.18
Yet, the fundamental problem of the enormoxis expenditure of the imperial household was its size. The Forbidden City, an area of a quarter of a square mile, was covered with blocks of glaze-tiled palatial buildings and ceremonial halls and gates, marble terraces, and endless painted galleries.
It was surrounded by the Imperial City, an area of no less than three square miles, also closed to the public. Within the enclosure were numerous avenues and several artificial lakes. In addition to imperial villas, temples, and residences of eunuch officials inside the compound, there were also supply depots and material-processing plants. Among them was the Court of Imperial Entertainments, which had the capacity to serve banquets for up to
15,0	men on short notice. Next to the bakeiy, distillery, and confectionery were the emperor’s stable, armoiy，printing-office，and book depository.
In sum, the palace was completely self-sufficient; all materials needed to support the Forbidden City were either deposited or being manufactured in this huge maintenance area, whose parklike surroundings were also used for sports and recreation. Moreover, certain articles consumed at sacrificial services and distributed to the personnel outside the palace, including wax and incense, as well as cotton cloth and cotton wadding for making the uniforms of the capital garrison, were also stored in the warehouses within the Imperial City. With few exceptions, all those supply depots and installations were supervised by eunuchs, who were organized into twenty-four departments.19 During the early years of Wan-li, there were close to 20,000 eunuchs, counting those holding official ranks on a par with top bureaucrats down to messengers and household attendants; the number was still increasing steadily. The palace staff also included 3,000 women.20
To make things worse, this huge staff, like the bureaucracy, was grossly underpaid. This situation reflected the system established by the dynastic founders. Since the emperor owned all that was within the Four Seas, there was no need for him to maintain substantial estates. Instead, he derived from tax proceeds large quantities of material and manufactured goods—from silk to metal ingots and from lumber to sesame seeds—and these were deposited immediately next to his palatial quarters, what was then the largest logistical base in the world. Officials, who were expected to live in extreme austerity, were from time to time handed out some of the goods set aside by the emperor, either as a bonus after a sacrificial ceremony or as outright bestowals from the throne.
But by the sixteenth century officialdom no longer lived in austerity. The top-ranking eunuchs carried on a life style differing little from that of the top bureaucrats. Feared and venerated, they too kept magnificent mansions within the Imperial City, staffed with household managers, personal secretaries, and domestic servants. By custom, palace women lived with them as if they were married. Although obviously without offspring, they patronized adopted sons, nephews, and sometimes junior eunuchs.21 Their methods of gaining irregular income also resembled conventional bureaucratic practices.
For the rank-and-file palace attendants，a major source of personal gain was their control of supply depots. Every month delivery agents from the provinces would arrive with assorted materials in lieu of tax payments. Unless these were found to fulfill specifications，the cargo would not be accepted and the deliverers, unable to discharge their responsibility, would be stranded in Peking. This quality control could，however，be drastically modified by paying a fee. Usually the deliveiy agent would approach an intermediary, who received the money and guaranteed acceptance of the cargo in question. During Wan-li5s reign, the most influential intermediary agent operating around the supply depots was Li Wei, earl of Wu-chsing, Tz'u-sheng's own father—or, to put it bluntly, in private life the reigning emperor’s maternal grandfather.
As the earl，in collaboration with the palace eunuchs，continued to turn in substandard materials for profit, the army personnel became angry, for the cotton cloth thxis checked in was issued to them for their uniforms. In 1577, the young emperor was persuaded to take one bolt of the inferior cloth and complain to Tz’u-sheng. Humiliated，the empress dowager wanted the case settled by law. At this point Tutor Chang interceded. Instead of going to court，Li Wei was summoned to stand in front of the palace to receive a reprimand. After the event Chang Chü-cheng was jubilant. He seized the opportunity to place dozens of eunuchs in charge of the supply depots; the demand for “cushion money” at those installations came to a halt. Throughout the maneuver Chang had the cooperation of Director of Ceremonies Feng Pao. Nevertheless, this heroic act was to have repercussions later.22
Affairs of state in the first decade of Wan-lfs reign, from 1572 to 1582, showed a remarkable improvement over the conditions of the previous hundred years. Nomadic invasions no longer threatened the northern frontier. Pirates disappeared from the eastern coasts. After a prolonged period of peace，imperial coffers were well stocked with silver bullion，thanks to Chang Chü-cheng’s administration. This was more than a boy emperor and his secluded mother could have hoped for. No wonder that when Tutor Chang had a minor stomach disorder, Wan-li volunteered to fix him a bowl of noodle soup! Tz’u-sheng’s deference to the grand-secretaiy was even more complete. A very religious person，she had made up her mind to contribute from her own purse to the construction of a temple in honor of a certain goddess; it was at Chang Chü-cheng’s advice that the project was  
abandoned. The alternate plan of constructing a stone bridge outside Peking with the same money was presented to her without prior consultation. Similarly，when Wan-li caught the measles，the empress dowager promised to offer upon his recovery an altar for masses in thanks for Buddha’s mercy. Because of Chang’s objection, this promise was never fulfilled either. More than once Tz’u-sheng wished to have the annual autumn execution of prisoners suspended in the name of mercy; Chang Chü-cheng argued that such extreme leniency had no genuine basis in Buddhist teaching. Not all such rulings had been easy for the empress dowager to accept, especially in 1574, when, after her intercession failed, more than thirty prisoners were beheaded the next day.23
On an ordinaiy working day the emperor acted upon two to three dozen documents that were brought to his attention. Each was written on a long sheet of paper folded screen-fashion to form a pamphlet of four, eight, twelve, or more pages. The documents differed from one another in format, according to their classification, the number of characters on each page, and style of writing. But in general they fell into two major categories. Those submitted by capital officials in the name of their offices, along with reports and petitions from the provinces, carried imprints of official seals; they had to go through the Office of Transmission, When they reached the palace, duplicates had already been delivered to the Office of Supervising Secretaries at the two wings of the Meridian Gate. Very rarely would such public documents cause serious disturbances in the emperors court. Capital ofYlcials, however, were entitled to submit memorials to the emperor as individuals, sometimes delivered by the writers themselves and received by palace eunuchs at the Gate of Polar Convergence. Without duplicates until the emperors rescript was attached and sent to the supervising secretaries for publication, these personal petitions and their contents remained confidential, unknown even to the writers, superiors. Many a controversy was caused by papers in the latter category.
When Wan-li was in his early teens, he merely followed Big Companion Feng's instructions, affixing his own rescripts in vermilion ink on certain papers to make official the drafts in black submitted by Tutor Chang!s office. The documents that he personally worked on involved simple replies such as Approved and	梦d. When the rescripts required com¬
plicated phraseology, the work was, as a rule, delegated to Feng Pao^ squad of assistants. These proceedings were completely in agreement with the dynasty's established practice. An instruction written in red in the emperor’s presence carried the authority of the throne. On the other hand， any unauthorized use of the vermilion brush constituted falsification of imperial order, a crime subject to the mandatory death penalty.
It must have been some time before the young emperor grasped the mechanics of the institutional process, of which he himself was the central figure. There is no evidence，for instance，that, when in those early days he carried out his official duty in a way not fundamentally different from taking calligraphy lessons, he fully understood the import of his own rescript Acknowledged, which really meant that the suggestion or request expressed in the paper had been politely rejected, and that, considering the noncontroversial nature of the proposal, no action would be taken against the writer of the paper or others mentioned therein. One duty Wan-li could not delegate had to do with his power of appointment. The problem was solved in this way: whenever there was a vacancy in a high office, Tutor Chang and the ministers always submitted more than one candidate for the emperor's selection. When he circled one name with his vermilion brush, that person was appointed, and the emperor had ostensibly made a decision of his own. However, he had early been indoctrinated to believe that the person whose name topped the list was best qualified.24
Until Wan-li reached his adolescence, about the time, in 1575, when he performed the ceremony to report to his ancestors that thereafter he was to wear his hair long, his understanding of his own role was limited to several simple notions: that he had become emperor not by merit but owing to the will of Heaven; that this will would continue to hold true as long as he kept the populace content and happy and the world in harmony; that in order to do so he must put good men in office and get rid of evil ones; and that in all these areas Tutor Chang’s advice must be followed because he always knew best. It must therefore have been a shock to Wan-li when，soon after his long-hair ceremony, he began to receive memorials naming Chang Chü-cheng an impostor and criticizing him for meting out penalties to others, not in the interests of the empire but to suit his own selfish designs. The most disturbing fact was that one of those remonstrating papers put the blame on the emperor himself. The three years5 reign of His Majesty, the memorialist claimed, was noted for harshness toward those who worked tirelessly for the throne. This was contrary to the teaching of the ancient sages，who had repeatedly stressed that moral leadership starts from kindness and gentleness, that only through forgiveness will the good feelings under Heaven be nurtured and promoted. The present state of affairs indicated that the emperor was under the influence of evil counsel.
Faced with direct attacks and indirect charges, Chang Chü-cheng turned in his resignation to comply with the principle that，be the criticism just or unjust, a public figure with self-esteem should never cling to his position when being criticized. After all, his usefulness had already been nullified when he was openly proclaimed an obstacle between the imperial throne and public confidence. But the emperor absolutely refused to listen to these arguments. He was predisposed, rather, to punish the critics. A confidential meeting with Tutor Chang and the Big Companion further confirmed his suspicion that the memorialists were destructive and malicious. At this point Chang Chü-cheng pointed out that anyone working immediately under His Majesty was obliged to mete out punishments, call them what one wished. Good men must be rewarded and evil men punished. Otherwise how could state affairs be managed?
Thus the imperial decision was made. The first official who had raised the question of Tutor Chang’s ill management was deprived of his rank and discharged from the Civil Service. The second challenger, knowing the likelihood of imperial displeasure over the remonstrance yet obstinately persisting in his argument, had in fact committed an act disrespectful to the throne. It was ordered that he be arrested, stripped of his robe before the Meridian Gate, and beaten with whipping clubs for a hundred strokes. A standard instrument for chastising insubordination, these clubs, with their rough sectional joints, had claimed many lives and left permanent scars on the thighs and hips of those who survived.25
But Chang Chü-cheng had no intention of letting the emperor go to such extremes. He interceded by petitioning the sovereign to omit the beating. The offender was exiled to the frontier instead. At this point the Wan-li emperor was much impressed by the magnanimity of his tutor, who would even beg for clemency on behalf of someone who had unjustly criticized him. He did not know, yet at least, that a person who gave offense to Chang Chü-cheng had to endure all kinds of harassments at the hands of numerous governmental functionaries, who believed that any additional injury they could inflict on the victim would ingratiate themselves with the grand-secretary, someone who could really deal out punishments. Only much later did the emperor learn that this second offender, though he escaped beating at the Meridian Gate, was tormented by everyone on his way to his exile and eventually died at the frontier post under most mysterious circumstances.
As time went by，however，Wan-li’s understanding of his own surroundings was broadened by his study of history. Gradually he realized that 
monarchy under the Ming differed from that of previous dynasties. In any other period when the emperor was a minor, a regency would have been established for him. An uncle or a cousin would have acted as prince regent. This was not permitted under the Ming dynasty’s constitution. A standing procedure established in the very early years of the dynasty had demanded that all imperial princes, including the emperor's uncles, cousins, younger brothers, and sons except for the heir apparent, be permanently removed from the capital upon reaching maturity. They were given territorial titles, palatial mansions, and annual stipends for life. But, settled in the provinces，they could never enter into politics; and without the emperors explicit approval they could not even travel. The fundamental idea was to free the monarchy from interference by cadet branches of the imperial family.
A similar preventive measure dictated that imperial consorts must be selected from families of humble origin, not from those of social distinction. Wan-li’s own maternal grandfather，Li Wei，had been a commoner of meager means. Only after Tz，u-sheng’s elevation from palace woman to imperial consort did Li receive noble titles. Yet even then his earldom gave him no more than an honorific commission in the army with a modest stipend, accompanied by neither land grant nor active service. The only governmental functions in which he took part were ceremonial. It was to supplement his insufficient family income that Li Wei chose to be an intermediary between tax deliverers and palace eunuchs. One of his three sons became a palace eunuch himself.26
The dynasty had had only three prime ministers; they were all executed by the dynastic founder. Since the last one had been put to death for trea- son，no one had ever again been appointed to that position. The employment of grand-secretaries to fill the gap involved a certain ambiguity. A grand- secretaiy was an accomplished literate, having won high placement at the Civil Service examinations and, as a result of his talents, sent on to the Han-lin Academy for advanced study. Once appointed grand-secretary at the Literaiy Depth Pavilion, his duties were confined to putting the emperors declarations and rescripts into an elegant prose style. At the beginning it was never conceived that a grand-secretaiy would become a policymaker. Because of its long-term continuity, the influence of the office steadily expanded during the middle period of the dynasty. Yet, until the reign of the Chia-ching emperor，the present emperor’s grandfather, in their limited capacity of providing counsel to the throne，the three to six grand-secretaries had still worked as a team. The monarch might see a senior grandsecretary at more frequent intervals，but this did not demote the others to subordinate rank.27 By the time Chang Chü-cheng became senior grand-secretary, however, he was indeed chief. The appointment of other grand- secretaries, all nominated by him, carried Wan-li's specific instruction to serve under Tutor Chang. This change undoubtedly sparked controversy.28
The essence of the constitutional arrangements and practices was that imperial power could not be delegated and in theory never had been delegated. But the principle could never have been enforced to the full， especially while the emperor was still a boy. Many years later Wan-li could laugh at the thought that his courtiers expected him to make his own decisions on numerous state issues when he was only twelve. At that time, if he remembered at all, he merely referred to Tutor Chang those instructions he had received from Big Companion Feng, and to the latter those rescripts drafted by Chang. That was why both of them were so indispensable. It would not have occurred to Wan-li that the close affiliation be-tween the senior grand-secretary and the eunuch director in charge of the palace staff might also raise a controversial issue.
Despite the general misconception, eunuchs in Ming times could not be accurately labeled as domestic servants who rose to meddle in state affairs. It was true that every eunuch had to go through the process of selfcastration before being selected to enter the palace, and for this reason eunuchs as a group usually gave an impression of being lowly born. But it would be a gross mistake to believe that none of them had achieved prominence by merit. Even during the reign of the first emperor, Hung-wu, eunuchs were frequently dispatched to tributary states as the sovereign’s personal envoys and to the provinces as tax auditors.29 After the middle period of the dynasty, their service as the emperors personal secretaries had become essential to the palace operation, as by then several dozen memorials required imperial attention every day. Those papers were as a rule lengthy, with technical discourse mingled with doctrinal polemics. Even with careful reading, it was difficult to grasp the main issues and peripheral subtleties，not to mention the number of administrative terms and long lists of proper names. The Director of Ceremonies, who handled the papers，employed several senior eunuchs to examine these documents before reporting to the throne.
Few of the papers were held inside the palace or acted upon directly. The majority were dispatched to the grand-secretaries at the Literary Depth Pavilion for rescript writing. To sustain this process it was vital that the eunuchs in charge be prepared to brief the sovereign the next morning. Often they had to take turns working until midnight.
During their closed-door session with the emperor in the morning, it was the duty of these half-dozen eunuchs to advise the sovereign either to read the complete text of the memorial or merely to scan the significant parts of it，giving close attention to certain names and arguments. The emperor could approve the rescripts drafted by the grand-secretaries in toto or sometimes with minor revisions，especially in phraseology. In theory he could also reject the draft altogether and produce a rescript of his own. This sovereign right, however, was rarely exercised in practice. One implication of such a practice was that, under those circumstances, the grand-secretary concerned would be compelled to resign; and that should be prevented from happening for as long as possible. Normally，grand-secretaries were expected to hold office for life. Good emperors should induce their grand- secretaries to draft rescripts that were to their liking.
Although it was not impossible for an illiterate eunuch who had won the emperor’s favor to break into this inner circle by becoming the Director of Ceremonies, such cases were few. Most of those in elevated positions had qualified for and earned them. A dominant majority had graduated from the Inner Palace School, which they first attended when they were no older than ten. Already screened for unusual talent and potential，they were given a classical education in no way different from that of the bureaucrats. In fact，their tutors were often the best talent of the Han_lin Academy. Not regular members of the Civil Service, those specially selected eunuchs nevertheless had gone through many rounds of competition among themselves as well as learning on the job as assistants and understudies to senior eunuchs before attaining their own seniority. Some of them had the skill to improve the style of writing of the grand-secretaries and to correct the wrong radicals of the characters. Since the emperor customarily signed only several documents a day, most state papers carried finishing touches by those eunuchs. If they did not inject their own ideas into the work, they at least kept the emperor informed of His Majesty’s own doings, which was in itself a significant task.
This small group of confidential secretarial personnel, like other senior eunuchs，wore red robes，not black，which was the color of palace attendants. The most distinguished among the half-dozen, the Director of Ceremonies included, wore jackets with special designs authorized by the emperor, thus commanding prestige and influence above ministerial officials. From time to time one or two were even granted the special privilege of riding horses on avenues within the palace compound. Still better, the pinnacle of palatial honor was to be carried in a sedan chair—a most coveted privilege that was nothing short of viceregal significance. But when the system functioned well, the small party of eunuchs confined their ostentation to the palace. Separated from the bureaucracy and holding office at the emperors pleasure, they were responsible to the sovereign himself. Their work remained anonymous; they would forever be unsung heroes within the governmental structure.30
Because of his closeness to Chang Chü-cheng，however, Feng Pao was not destined to remain unsung. Until the Wan-li emperor reached maturity he had not the slightest suspicion that his Big Companion would one day fall into the classic pattern of evil eunuchs, whose personal ambitions could ruin dynasties—a lesson he had come across often in his historical studies. On the contrary, Feng Pao was discreet and unassuming. Not an accomplished scholar, he nevertheless loved books and calligraphy, and indulged in such gentlemanly pastimes as playing the lute and chess. It was because of such attitudes that he earned Tz’u-sheng’s confidence. Moreover，he had come a long way to reach his present distinction. A personal secretary to the Chia-ching emperor, he was in charge of the Eastern Depot during the reign of Lung-ch’ing，Wan-li’s father. That agency，with the Silk Robe Guard under its control, was responsible for the security of the capital and for the supplying of secret information to the throne. After holding that sensitive position，Feng’s promotion to Director of Ceremonies was only to be expected according to the dynasty’s custom. But he was put aside by Kao Kung for a number of years. After Kao5s dismissal he had finally advanced to this position, the highest any eunuch could hope to attain.31
In the autumn of 1577, the emperor’s court was put to a serious test. Imperial Tutor Chang Chü-cheng’s father had died in Hukwang. Standard procedure would have required the grand-secretary to relinquish his position and return to his native district to observe the period of mourning for twenty-seven months.32 When his request for relief from duty came, Wan-li did not take it seriously, however. The emperor had already conferred with his two mothers and decided that Chang was irreplaceable. It could not be otherwise. His Majesty had recently celebrated his fifteenth birthday; both state affairs and his own education still required Tutor Chang's supervision. With the help of Feng Pao, he composed his own rescript in a mixed tone of command and entreaty urging Chang to stay in office. The grandsecretary resubmitted his request to leave two more times; Wan-li in his turn repeated the order, holding that Change service could not be suspended and denying the request for leave. In his last rescript he also added that this was the empress dowager’s wish. The correspondence，sent back and forth between the palace office and the Lit亡rary Depth Pavilion not more than a thousand yards away, served a public purpose. Along with other documents, the papers eventually turned up at the Office of Supervising Secretaries for publication, where dozens of clerical workers made copies from the originals so that the entire court could read the full texts.
But there was little indication that the public was convinced either of Chang Chü-cheng’s genuine desire to leave office or even that the wish to retain him had truly come from the imperial family. Official historians and readers-in-waiting of the Han-lin Academy，conscious of their position as members of the literary-educational branch of the government and therefore morally bound to keep the emperors court in harmony with the teaching of ancient sages, were deeply disturbed. They realized that the dynasty stood upon its moral character, which was its strength. Otherwise it would never be able to govern the people. The secret of administering an enormous empire such as ours was not to rely on law or the power to regulate and punish but to induce the younger generation to venerate the old, the women to ob^y their menfolk，and the illiterate to follow the examples set by the learned. In all these areas the example set by the emperor’s court was of paramount importance. Many of those Han-lin academicians had come from rural communities themselves. They knew that government by law had its limitations. But when a person was moved by the principles of loyalty and filial piety he would always remain upright and law-abiding. He would align himself behind his village leaders and kinship groups and conduct himself properly. These principles must nevertheless be repeatedly stressed, promoted, and expounded. What would the imperial subjects think now，if the emperor’s own tutor regarded the requirement of mourning for a deceased parent as a mere gesture, to be performed only as long as it served his purpose and dispensed with when it did not?33
While the emperor remained unaware of it, scores of Han-lin academicians invited the minister of personnel to join them and marched him to Chang Chü-cheng’s residence for a personal interview and appeal. They wished to persuade the grand-secretaiy to give up his pretension to being indispensable. Even for his own good，he should retire from active service for the required twenty-seven months in order to gain credibility for many years to come. The confrontation, however, was fruitless. The emperor, Chang argued, had personally commanded him to stay. How could a selfappointed committee come to his house and advise him to act to the contrary? Furthermore, Minister of Personnel Chang Han was in fact Chang Chü-cheng's protege, having received his present position through the grand-secretaiy’s intervention，which had put him ahead of two more qualified candidates. In the past four years he had also worked closely with Chang Chü-cheng in placing the grand-secretaiy^ other proteges. After this short interview Chang Han was impeached by several censors—not for this private meeting at the grand-secretary's house, but for some unrelated matters which otherwise would never have been brought up—and was forced into retirement. This hardly made the dissatisfied academicians happy. They knew that the censorial-supervisory branch of the government， involving some 110 investigating censors and 52 supervising secretaries, had long since been turned into a tool subservient to Chang Chü-cheng.
One more line of action was open to the academicians, however: they could submit their own impeaching memorials. Though such a move would be, strictly speaking, outside their domain and open to the risk of retaliation，their offering of loyal and disinterested advice to the throne was nevertheless justified by the unusual circumstances. The thousands of pages from the most fundamental works which they had learned to recite and write about assured them of the absolute correctness of their action. In the dynasty^ history, similar group remonstrances had been organized before. The initial petition was submitted by the lowest rank-holders among the bureaucrats，in mild language，to be followed by stronger arguments. If the sovereign were angered and decided to punish the memorialists，as was anticipated，the colleagues and superiors of the re- monstrators would eventually have to intervene. Petitioning for mercy on behalf of the offenders, they would find it inevitable to speak on the case at issue in such a way that the entire court would be forced to take a stand. Even if the remonstrance did not prevail, the public agitation produced by it would have achieved its purpose. The organizers of the campaign would then feel that they had done their best, and their deeds would in due course be registered in history.
The attempted impeachment of Chang Chü-cheng proceeded in such a fashion. The first two memorials were submitted by two Han-lin academicians. They merely argued that Chang, grieving over the demise of his father，could not manage public affairs with his usual wisdom. It was therefore both cruel and unwise for the imperial family to compel him to remain in office. A stronger tone was taken in the two succeeding papers, signed by junior members of the Ministry of Justice. Imperial Tutor Chang was said to be brazenly shameless to hang on to his sinecure; this would do irreparable damage to the dynasty’s revered traditions. Since Chang was unwilling to return to Hukwang, His Majesty the Emperor should issue him a stern order demanding his immediate departure and requiring him to remain at his father’s burial site in repentence. Only then could the atmosphere of the imperial court be cleared.
No one can say for sure how the subsequent events in late November of 1577 developed and were given the finishing touches. Eunuchs ran back and forth between Tutor Change house and the palace. Inevitably some of them relayed messages to the second grand-secretary, who was acting on Chang’s behalf while the case awaited the emperor’s decision. It is unclear what Feng Pao reported to the empresses dowager. The emperor himself probably knew less than anyone; several years later, when he reviewed the sequence of events, he would think that indeed he had known very little. But the record testifies that imperial rescripts in vermilion ink called for severe punishments to the petitioners. They had openly defied the throne and showed their contempt for it.34
The first two memorialists were beaten sixty strokes in front of the Meridian Gate with whipping clubs. After the punishment their names were removed from the Civil Service register. The other two remonstrators were dealt twenty more strokes than the first two offenders because of their bold arguments. Furthermore, they were exiled to the frontier for life, ineligible for future pardon. The soldiers at the Silk Robe Gtiard always had a political sense of how exactly the beating should be administered, and in this case the wrath of the grand-secretaiy was carried out in full force. Thus the first dozen strokes had already ripped the skin of the victims; the successive blows simply kneaded human flesh with blood-soaked whipping clubs. One of the victims lost consciousness; it was a miracle that he survived. Another survivor, it was noticed, lost one buttock. After the beating the soldiers carried the offending memorialists away on canvas sheets and dumped them on the pavement outside the Imperial City. Their families were permitted to take them home. But others who looked after and comforted them had their names taken by the secret agents of the Eastern Depot. Many of these people were later summoned to the depot for further questioning.
The action taken by the throne came so suddenly and with such resoluteness that other remonstrators never had a chance to carry out their part of the plan. A declaration, duly signed by the Wan-li emperor, charged the remonstrators with directly countering his expressed wishes, thxis exhibiting contempt for the throne. They were in reality taking advantage of his own youthfulness. Using morals and ethics as a pretext，they had attempted to deprive the emperor of his needed counsel so that they could do what they wished to satisfy their selfish purposes. The declaration went on to say that the punishment so far meted out was only a token penalty. Should the conspirators wish to proceed further，it promised to deal with them even more sternly. Thus a predetermined charge of treason awaited subsequent protestors. None came forth and the case was closed—at least for the next five years.
Chang Chü-cheng now attended his office in a cloth robe and a belt lined with ox-horn to express mourning. His salary was suspended as he had requested. But the emperor directed that portions of rice，tea，salt，vegetable oil, candles， firewood, and charcoal be regularly delivered to his residence. Wine and delicacies were supplied him by the Court of Imperial Entertainments every day. In protest dozens of disgruntled courtiers submitted their resignations. Since they pleaded only poor health and family reasons, the requests were routinely granted with no questions asked. The Secret Police had no reason to report to the emperor the handbills denouncing Chang Chü-cheng as a traitor which now appeared in the streets of Peking. Unsuccessful in making arrests, they could only quickly destroy the subversive literature that fell into their possession.
Grand-Secretaiy Chang changed into a red robe with a jade belt to celebrate Wan-li^ imperial wedding in early 1578, then changed back into mourning dress to return to his native Chiang-ling for » vacation from mid-April to mid-July. His official duties were not interrupted，however. On important state matters the emperor dispatched the essential documents to him by special couriers who covered a distance of roughly one thousand miles.
Most likely, at that time the emperor had no inkling of the luxury in which Tutor Chang traveled. With the Secret Police under Big Companion Feng’s supervision, such reports never reached the throne. But others knew that during the journey Chang was carried in a specially designed sedan chair which could have foreshadowed the railroad cars to come many centuries later. It was large enough to be divided into a bed-chamber and a reception room, staffed with two attendants and hauled by thirty-two bearers. The grand-secretary，s bodyguards included a contingent of musketeers furnished by General Ch’i Chi-kuang. Enroute the emperor’s chief counsellor was not only a guest of honor of civil officials, but also was greeted by imperial princes in residence who broke tradition to come out from the city walls to welcome him. In Honan he visited his old adversary now in retirement, the former grand-secretary Kao Kung, in order to make peace with him. Kao, already ill, correctly believed that he had only several months to live. Chang Ch(i-cheng，in turn，pointed out that the hair at his own tem_ pies had turned gray, even though he was only in his early fifties. Dtiring this reunion Chang never anticipated that their antagonism had yet to be laid to rest，or that it would take its toll when both men were in their graves.35
For Chang Chti-cheng，it was heart-warming that he continued to hold the confidence of the emperor. The tutor explained to the young sovereign that he himself was unpopular merely because he wanted to give the throne his devoted service. The emperor replied that he understood; and he appreciated his tutors loyalty and dedication, which Kcould penetrate the sky.” Before he took leave in April，Chang’s farewell in the palace was a moment of truth. Both the grand-secretaiy and the emperor shed tears. The three months’ separation seemed to last much longer. Upon Chang’s return Wan-li was very pleased as well as relieved. That autumn Chang Chü-cheng’s mother also arrived in Peking. She was immediately rushed to the imperial palace, where the two empresses dowager drew her into their inner circle and showered her with gifts. On that happy occasion neither mother nor son realized that imperial favor was an expendable thing; when it was used up there was an end to it, and as such it lacked the lingering effect of the good will of common people under ordinary circumstances.36
The imperial wedding in early 1578 v^as not an exciting event. The emperor was only fourteen years old; his bride， daughter of a commoner hastily given an army commission, was barely thirteen. Needless to say, this was not a union of love. Wan-li merely abided by his mother’s wish to have many grandchildren as soon as possible. The installation of a principal wife to the ruler legitimated his nuptials with other consorts, of whom two were declared official only ten days after the wedding ceremony.
Most unfortunate was Empress Hsiao-tuan, as she is known to history. She was, from her wedding day, permanently encased in palatial pomp and comfort; yet, by the cruel exigency of tradition, her marriage was only a state necessity, reducing her to an accessory to an institution, entitled to all kinds of meaningless honors but to little satisfaction as a wife. She bore the emperor a daughter and lived almost as long as he did. But at no time did she in any way affect the course of his life. As the principal daughter-in-law to Jen-sheng, the emperors principal mother, she had both the privilege and the obligation of attending her in public, such as helping her from her sedan chair, a task Hsiao-tuan performed exactly as required, thus earning for herself a reputation for filial piety. Inside the palace, however, she was better remembered as a ruthless mistress who frequently ordered her chambermaids beaten, sometimes to death.37
Yet, if Wan-li paid little attention to Hsiao-tuan, neither did he show much interest in the other two consorts. The important women in his life were yet to enter the picture, almost four years after his wedding to Hsiao- tuan, by the end of 1581 and later.
In the meantime the adolescent monarch was restless. The palace compound was magnificent but also oppressively monotonous. Even with those balustrades, incense burners, sculptured birds, and bronze lamps on stone bases, the Forbidden City comprised by and large the same architecture and routines over and over again. On fixed dates, the platoons and battalions of attendants changed from fur-lined robes with ear-covers, into silk, and then into light-weight gauze for the summer. Flowers were taken out from winter storage, leaves were raked, and ditches dredged—all according to a prearranged schedule. Yet palace life remained timeless and seasonless, lacking either the thrill of surprise or the excitement of anticipation. As emperor, Wan-li could not venture outside the palace compound. He could not even think of dropping in to visit his courtiers at home; no ritualistic proceedings to govern such behavior had been established in the dynasty’s history.
But after his wedding Wan-li was at least free from Tz’u-sheng’s daily supervision. Soon he discovered that life could be slightly more interesting. Sun Hai, a eunuch attendant, advised him to organize drinking parties with other attendants in the villas within the Imperial City. This was not exactly a city in the ordinary sense. The western portion of the enclosure was an immense park, with lakes, marble bridges, and white stone towers. The more than one thousand cranes hovering near the Lamaist temple in particular gave the area a feeling of warmth and informality, in contrast to the regimentation within the Forbidden City. Now the emperor often loitered both in and outside the gardens for fun, wearing tight-sleeved garments and carrying a sword, frequently under the influence of alcohol. One night in 1580, at seventeen，during one such meny hour Wan-li demanded that two palace women sing songs they were not familiar with. For their failure to obey the imperial order they were sentenced to death on the spot—a penalty carried out only symbolically, by cutting off tassels of their hair. Other attendants who tried to intervene were beaten. The incident was eventually reported to Tz5u-sheng by none other than Big Companion Feng Pao.
The empress dowager decided that such misconduct on the part of a monarch called for dethronement. She announced that Wan-li would be replaced by Prince Lu. Preparation had been made for herself, stripped of all regalia of honor because of her failure to provide her son with proper guidance, to report the decision to the family temple. At this point Wan-li knelt down before her in repentance. Only after holding out for over an hour did she accept his apology, on the condition that he would settle the case of misconduct with Chang Chü-cheng.
The grand-secretaiy made the sovereign pledge, in writing, to rectify himself. The attendants who had led him astray were ordered to report to the army. A review of the palace roster of personnel made with Feng Pao ended with the mass discharging of the emperor's favorite eunuchs, many of them merely because of their interest in sports. Tutor Chang further made himself responsible for the emperor’s conduct even within the palace and free to advise the throne on private matters. Beginning in early 1581 he daily assigned four Han-lin academicians to keep company with the emperor, as an aid to His Majesty^ effort toward ccsettling the mind and cultivating virtue.”38
One area, however, Change surveillance could not reach. The hundreds of palace women were the emperor’s property; no relationship involving them with him was illicit, because any liaison could be legitimated by granting the lady in question the title of secondary wife. The Ruler of All Men was entitled to one empress, usually one principal consort, a number of associate consorts, and still more concubines. Ever since the Cheng-te emperor had died without an heir, it had been generally recognized that the throne must widen the possibility of producing male offspring to assure regular succession.
Palace women were selected from the general population around Peking. Sometimes as many as three hundred were admitted to the imperial household as a group. Between the ages of nine and fourteen，the young girls were nominated by the precinct and village elders according to quotas assigned to the communities, and subsequently went through many rounds of screening and selection before they entered the palace gate，which to most of them was a point of no return for the rest of their lives.
Those nymphs inside the Forbidden City became a frequent topic of erotic literature. They were likened to sculptured jade yet said to be freshly fragrant，appearing either as voluptuous as fully blossomed peach trees glowing in the morning sun, or as slender and delicate as jasmine vibrating in an evening breeze. In reality, palace women were never unpleasant to look at, yet hardly so glamorous and disturbingly beautiful as the romantic poets described them because eye-catching quality had never been the standard for selection.
The tears and loneliness of the girls who grew up within the palace compound must, however, have been real. Unless a palace woman caught the fancy of the emperor, the only male in the palace (as Tz5u-sheng herself had done, and thus was elevated to what she was today), her life was forlorn indeed. Having wasted her flourishing years as a chambermaid, she either had to find the sympathy of a compatible eunuch in her middle age or be sent to the northwest corner of the palace to perform miscellaneous labors. Upon her death her remains would be cremated and buried in an unmarked grave to assure that neither rumor nor legend could arise around one who theoretically had been accessible to emperor or emperors in her lifetime. With so slim a chance of eliciting imperial favor, the lot of palace women was so uninviting that when an impending selection was an-nounced, many thoughtful parents quickly married off their young daughters to eliminate their eligibility.39
But in the winter of 1581 that slim chance befell one of Tz，u-sheng’s chambermaids, later known as Lady Wang. She captured Wan-li^ fancy and became pregnant. For some time the liaison was kept from the empress dowager, as it was feared that the illicit connection would incur her displeasure. In March 1582, when the emperor chose nine concubines one day at his mother’s direction，Lady Wang was not even included. But soon afterward，when Tz’u-sheng discovered the liaison and Lady Wang’s pregnancy, she was far from displeased. On the contrary, she was elated by the prospect of a grandson. In July, the title of Consort Kung was conferred upon Lady Wang to enable her to give birth in late August with ample legitimacy to the Wan-li emperor’s first son，Ch’ang-lo, later known to the courtiers as “the eldest imperial son.” To celebrate the event，the imperial decree announcing the good tidings also proclaimed a general amnesty and tax remission throughout the realm. Special envoys were dispatched to Korea, the nearest tributary state, to break the news. Yet nowhere was Ch'ang-lo referred to as an imperial prince. By tradition, until the title was formally conferred, he was not one.40
With all this going on, 1582 was a year crowded with events. Its climax was the death of Chang Chü-cheng. In order to effect a basic cure of the  
empire’s fiscal administration，the senior statesman had，in the name of the Wan_li emperor，ordered a national land survey; but his death came before the returns were consolidated. When Chang was first ill, it was disclosed that he had some difficulty in moving his bowels and laxatives were all that were needed. The sudden demise of such an energetic and alert person at the age of fifty-seven came as a profound shock to many, although it made others rejoice. Hardly nine days before, already seriously ill, Tutor Chang had been granted the title of Grand Preceptor，the highest honor any civil official could hope to attain—in fact，an honor that had not been conferred upon a living soul over the past two hundred years. Chang did not live long enough to put Jiis additional prestige to work, to add more substance to his administration; nor did he have the opportunity to congratulate the emperor on the arrival of a son before his nineteenth birthday.41
In this connection, the installation of nine imperial concubines that year was important，as among them was Lady Cheng，then fourteen years old. How could an emperor of eighteen, with eveiy desirable female within arm’s length，prefer a romantic love affair with such an innocent little thing—one among at least a dozen who had been chosen for the sole purpose of providing the dynasty with reserve heirs—to his union with the woman who had infatuated him and given birth to his first son? More inscrutable still was the fact that this love was later said to have lasted throughout the rest of their lives and became a major cause of the tccon- stitutional crisis” that was destined to make a prosperous empire unhappy. In fact, Lady Cheng at no time monopolized the emperors attention. He was yet to have eight sons and ten daughters born of eight wives. He had a daughter by Lady Wang twenty-seven months after meeting Cheng. Furthermore, the emperor was later known to have been very much in love with another consort, Lady Li. Only her early death prevented her from leaving a significant impression on his life.42
Whether Wan-li^ relationship with Lady Cheng should be called romantic love is debatable. The stories leaked out about her through palace eunuchs never established her as a great beauty. But she was said to have been intelligent, well-read, and strong-willed. Above all, she must have shared certain interests in life with Wan-li. Those qualities enabled her to satisfy his emotional needs.
Immediately after Tutor Chang’s death, the emperor freed himself from the daily surveillance by the Han-lin academicians. Becoming a father that summer, he must have felt the relaxation of control by mother Tz'u-sheng. Yet his new sense of freedom never again induced him to keep company  
with rowdy eunuchs. He had truly come of age. It was about this time that he turned into an avid reader. Not only did he order his grand-secretaries to provide him with copies of the Veritable Records of the reigns preceding his own, but he also let his eunuch attendants purchase in Peking any newly published books they could lay hands on, including poetry, collections of essays, medical books, plays, novels, and detective stories. His delight in these printed pages was shared with Lady Cheng.43
Some of this reading material was marginally pornographic. What made a woman a woman? Was she supposed to enjoy sexual acts in bed? What made her part her lips and close her eyes? Did a flower love to have its ovary sucked by a honey bee? Popular literature, which rose phenomenally during His Majesty’s reign, was full of sensual suggestion, though the vulgarity was as a rule made less offensive by poetry. How deeply did the emperor himself become involved in this development?
For many years to come Wan-li was to be criticized by his bureaucrats for his preoccupation with the “pleasure of women.” His critics never seemed to understand, however, that imperial polygamy was basically utilitarian. Such pleasure as it yielded was at a low level. The ecstasy of love-making created by a freeing of body and mind in unison was hardly possible between a demigod and his terrified subject; for the latter in all likelihood had been awed to numbness beforehand. Even Wan-li，s attraction to Lady Cheng could not have been primarily physical. If it had been, with all the alternatives available to him, his fondness for her could never have been so enduring. On a later occasion he confided to Grand-Secretary Shen Shih- hsing that Lady Cheng took good care of him. That must have been what gave him a sense of emotional security.
Lady Cheng had come into Wan-li's life at the right moment to fill a void. Overnight she must have grasped the reality that, beneath the dragon robe he wore, was a lonesome and defenseless human being. Even his own mother was determined to run him like an institution. Realizing this, Lady Cheng quickly kept her rendezvous with destiny and attained instant womanhood. While other ladies distanced themselves from the emperor out of submission and fear, she teased him, laughed at him, and joked with him. If she had not put herself on an equal footing with him and appeared as more than his equal, how could she have provided the strength and assurance he wanted so badly? Now eunuchs reported that the emperor and Lady Cheng visited the temples and villas in the Imperial City together, a favor that he was not known to have extended to other consorts. On at least one occasion they were seen praying together in a chapel. If the word  
of the eunuchs can be trusted, Lady Cheng was frequently unhappy about the emperor’s indecisiveness. In such instances she would shout at him, “You are an old lady!”44
Being feminine and irresolute was something Wan-li had to shake himself loose from. In those hectic days of 1582 he strove to be diligent and attentive to his office, making a string of important decisions himself, especially on high-level appointments. Perhaps it was around this time that he watched his palace troupe put on a play called A Pardon Granted on the Hua Mountains, in which an unhappy emperor on stage chants: <cMy government is in the hands of the Ning family; and here I am，left to attend to ceremonies!” Eye-witnesses reported that the emperor in the audience was veiy disturbed，appearing to be as unhappy as the emperor onstage.45
But how to become a monarch with full authority, to rule as well as to reign? In Wan-li's case he still had to react to the memorandums brought to his attention, either to believe or disbelieve the arguments presented to him. Who were the memorialists? They were either followers of the deceased Grand Preceptor—those who owed him their career advancement, who had believed that he should be retained in office when his father died, and had prayed for his early recovery when he was ill—or else they were his enemies—those who believed that Chang Chü-cheng had been an impostor, a tyrant, and a hypocrite. In 1582, before the youthful emperor could fully appraise the situation, the pendulum in his court had swung back to favor the latter group. He had no knowledge that the official who had succeeded Chang Chü-cheng as first grand-secretary, Chang Ssu-wei, himself a protege of the senior Chang, was a close friend to his own maternal grandfather, Li Wei, earl of Wu-ch^ng, and an archenemy of the chief eunuch, Big Companion Feng Pao. Still less did he realize that Chang Ssu-wei, reading public opinion correctly, was ready to reverse what Chang Chü-cheng had done to make himself popular.46
The movement to conduct a purge of the policies of the late Grand Preceptor started without a fuss. Although Chang Chü-cheng^s name was not mentioned, an imperial decree acknowledged his national land survey to be a failure, as it had coerced provincial and local officials to over-report the cultivated acreages in their districts.47 Caught unaware, Wan-li accepted the argument that seemingly had been advanced in order to publicize his thoughtfulness as sovereign. The moment he put his vermilion brush to paper, hundreds of officials who had worked diligently for the project, especially those who had reported significant acreage increases, were exposed to shame; on the other hand, those who had ignored or discounted Chang’s instructions emerged as public heroes.
Encouraged by this event, in the next few months many inconspicuous figures went about impeaching other inconspicuous figures. It so happened that the censured were always in one way or another connected with the deceased Grand Preceptor. As their misdeeds were exposed, Chang Chü-cheng's record appeared to be more and more questionable. The momentum increased; accusations grew bolder and more direct in molding public opinion as it was stirred up. Slowly but irrevocably, Chang Chü-cheng emerged as having been very treacherous and deceitful. The purge gradually affected his close lieutenants, causing several with ministerial ranks to be removed. By the end of the year Chang was said to have cheated the emperor, plagued the population, accepted bribes, sold governmental offices, advanced his henchmen, let his household servants dominate and harass the officials, and even to have arranged marriages to perpetuate the association of his cohorts.48
The emperor now finally realized that his trust had been misplaced. Most difficult for him to accept was the fact that Tutor Chang, despite his endless lectures on frugality, had for all those years lived to a great extent in luxury. He had even filled his house with curios and rare paintings of all kinds. Although Chang had been widowed for a number of years, he had apparently maintained a harem of young women, some of them noted beauties who had been gifts offered by his lieutenants to gain his favor. Wan-li in quick succession felt saddened, wounded, humiliated, and enraged. Just to think that during all the years when he himself, the emperor, had felt he could not afford the necessaiy gifts for the palace women, and such gifts had had to be entered into the books in the form of vague promises to be kept some time in the future—to think that his grandfather had been forced to make a profit on tax cloth as a middleman and to suffer the humiliation of being scolded in public for wrong-doing—while Chang Chü-cheng, the saintly preacher, had all along been taking advantage of him and reaping all the benefits!
During the last days of 1582 and the early months of 1583, the emperor’s mind remained disturbed. That winter Grand-Secretary Chang Ssu-wei suggested that he select a site for his future mausoleum, which provided some distraction.49 In the early spring the triennial palace examination for the Civil Service candidates was due; Wan-li presided over the proceedings. The essay question was a short essay in itself, consisting of close to five hundred characters. In tune with the traditional custom of self-criticism, the sovereign asked the competing scholars why it was that the more he tried to tighten the administration, the more official corruption and breakdowns in law and order increased. Was it because he did not have sufficient kindness and gentleness within himself? Or had he been indecisive and irresolute? Undoubtedly the quiz had been prepared by the literary educational officials. The emperor’s mind was nevertheless at work when he selected it over several alternative questions, thus revealing his own uncertainty.50
His court was not so hesitant in promoting the denunciation of Chang Chü-cheng's movement, however. During the winter practically all the surviving offenders against the deceased Grand Preceptor had been recalled from banishment and exile and reinstated in office, whether they were misfits, inefficient, or men of solid character who had refused to compromise.51 But this movement could not go further and remain secure if Chang’s dose associate，Feng Pao, continued to occupy the sensitive position of Director of Ceremonies, with the Secret Police under his control. Two senior eunuchs, none other than Feng’s immediate assistants，were chosen to approach the sovereign. His Majesty must be made to understand that among his confidants Feng Pao was the most deceitful. The bribes he received from civil officials and top army officers were prodigious. In fact, on the day Chang Chü-cheng died，Feng went to Chang’s household and removed five curtains, all made of pearls. He also took nine pearls, some as large as eggs, that gave off light in the dark. The emperor was persuaded to press charges and confiscate the property. What remained unspoken was that, afterward, the two informing eunuchs were to receive as their spoils the offices vacated by Feng and his deputy, one for his directory and the other for the Eastern Depot.
Wan-li was still undecided.
“What would happen，’’ he asked，“if Big Companion came to the throne room and started a fuss?”
The eunuchs replied, smiling: “He can’t, Your Myriad Years. The moment your order is read to him he has to leave.”52
Eventually Feng Pao, stripped of his rank and title, was ordered to report to the mausoleum of the dynastic founder in Nanking. The charge against him，“deceiving the emperor and preying upon the nation,” needed no further substantiation. Since the legal concept was that all worldly goods belonged to the emperor and that individuals held property only at his pleasure, confiscation was a natural recourse when imperial pleasure was withdrawn.
The takeover of Feng Pao’s household goods delighted yet saddened the sovereign. They were not as fabulous as the informers had claimed them to be, but they were substantial enough. There were gems and bullion, musical instruments and art works of historical fame. Although nominally the emperor owned eveiything within the Four Seas, in reality the possessions of a eunuch could make him envious! Some of the confiscated items might come in handy, as the wedding of his own brother, Prince Lu, was approaching.53
The next logical step was to confiscate Chang Chü-cheng’s property too; it was said to exceed Feng’s in value. For a long time Wan-li could not take such a step. Whenever he thought about Tutor Chang, he had mixed feelings, which brought back memories from his boyhood and adolescence. On one of the memorials about Chang Chü-cheng which the courtiers urged the emperor to sign into a proclamation，he wrote that he did not wish to be ungrateful to someone who had served him diligently for a decade.
Had Lady Cheng in any way affected his decision? Were her nagging and stubbornness, which according to the courtiers ruined not only the reign of the present emperor but later those of a son and a grandson as well, factors that hardened his heart? No one could say for sure. But in the summer of 1583 she was promoted by Wan-li from imperial concubine to Consort Te; and two and a half years later he advanced her to imperial consort, thus putting her above all his secondary wives and making her inferior in rank only to the empress. There is little doubt that from this point on she held more of the emperors attention than anyone else. It was therefore unlikely that any important decision made by him was kept from her.
And there was Empress Dowager Tz^-sheng. Before the deposed grand-secretary Kao Kung died，he made numerous approaches to Li Wei，her father, in the hope that the earl would help him to reopen his case. But as long as Chang Chü-cheng was alive the latter could do little. In fact, his clandestine contact with Kao Kung had already been reported by the Secret Police.54 But this situation changed rapidly when Chang was dead and buried. In three months’ time, the earl of Wu-ch’ing became the marquis of Wu-ch’ing. His influence could no longer be overlooked when the wind in his grandson's court had turned so much in his favor. What he confided to his daughter remains unknown. But she was, at least on one occasion, overheard to mention the enormous assets of Chang Chü-cheng.55
Now a book supposed to have been written by Kao Kung, called Last Words on the Sick Bedy was found in print.56 In this memoir Kao insisted that he had been singled out in 1572 by the late Lung-ch'ing emperor as the principal guardian of the present emperor, then the heir designate. At the time, Kao had contemplated the removal of Feng Pao because the eunuch was known to have sold several official positions for profit. More serious  
still, on the first day the present emperor met the court, Feng, having escorted the sovereign designate to the dragon seat, did not step aside. Thus, when the officials kowtowed to the future emperor, they actually kowtowed to Feng Pao too. The eunuch，by using such a tricky maneuver to build up his own prestige, had already exposed his cynicism and contempt for the emperor. But before Kao could act, Feng had conspired with Chang Chü-cheng to secure from the imperial mothers the order of Kao's removal. The author did not deny outright his own remarks about the present emperor at the age of nine; but he claimed that he had been speaking of his fear that the new young sovereign might be misled by his eunuch attendants, as his granduncle, the Cheng-te emperor, had been when he ascended the throne before the age of fourteen.57
Kao, a master of deceit himself, could not have presented in this volume all the facts as they had occurred even if his authorship were genuine, which is very much in doubt. But it made little difference. The publication of the memoir was well timed; it captured the moment when many readers would seize upon it as nothing but the truth. Its many references to the names of witnesses had the tone and color of authenticity. But most of these witnesses were no longer alive when the book was published.
Last Words on the Sick Bed had yet more damage to render Chang Chü-cheng over the capture of Wang Ta-ch’en，said to have taken place on February 20,1573, or about a half-year after Wan-lfs accession and author Kao Kung’s banishment. This case was not merely fabrication. Official records corroborated that on that day, in the early morning, a man disguised as a eunuch had been seized by the guards at the main palace gate. Interrogation established that he was Wang Ta-ch'en, who had been a household servant but was then unemployed. The case was by no means unprecedented. Despite the vigilance at the palace gates, once in a while intruders managed to enter. It was unclear what Wang^ intention was. Kao Rung asserted in his memoir that Wang came from Ch5i Chi-kuang^s com-mand, and the exposure of his connection with the general would have embarrassed Chang Chü-cheng, who was then patronizing Ch5i in the face of strong criticism. At the same time, Feng Pao, having put Kao Kung under house arrest on the basis of distorted reports and false charges, was afraid that the dismissed grand-secretaiy would one day come forward to testify against him. The two decided to use Wang Ta-ch’en to frame an attempt on Wan-li's life so that Kao Kung could be permanently silenced. According to the memoir, Feng Pao had supplied the palace intruder with what appeared to be weapons for assassination but promised him immunity and a generous reward if he would confess that he had been sent there by the malcontent Kao Kung. To protect the scheme from discovery, Chang Chü-cheng was to arrange for a rapid trial and quick return of verdict so that Kao could be implicated and dealt capital punishment.
The scheme went awry because, first, the bureaucrats whom Chang Chü-cheng had canvassed refused to cooperate, and then, Wang Ta-ch'en, realizing at last the enormous risk he was taking, backed away from the arrangement at the preliminary trial at the Eastern Depot. Instead he threatened to tell the truth. Now Feng Pao, in desperation, ordered that poisonous wine be served to the prisoner that night until his vocal cords were destroyed. The public trial two days later produced only a speechless and defenseless prisoner. He was sentenced to death, and the sentence was immediately carried out to relieve the anxiety of the conspirators, whose plan had nearly backfired.
Now, a decade later, was the emperor to believe all this or to dismiss it as hearsay? There must be some substance to the stoiy. He still vaguely re-membered that at age nine he had been told that a bad man had sneaked into the palace compound. Tutor Chang!s warning still appeared in the journals. At one point the puzzled sovereign called for the files on this case of Wang Ta-ch^n. The papers, however, revealed little. They merely indicated that the trespasser by that name who had two daggers concealed under his robe was executed on March 25, 1573. Yet Kao Kung's friends were so convinced of the authenticity of the intrigue that they engraved the stoiy of the plot on Kao’s tombstone.58
Wan-li ordered an inquiry to find out the truth. Only on the advice of Grand-Secretary Shen Shih-hsing was the order withdrawn. Except for Feng Pao, all principal characters referred to in the case, including the trial judge, had died within the ten-year period. The investigation was likely to create serious disturbance without arriving at adequate conclusions. Yet, in one way Kao Kung's memoir had already achieved its purpose. Never again could the Wan-li emperor think of his deceased tutor with even mixed respect and affection. He and his mothers had thought that Chang had secured the throne for him while he was helplessly young. It turned out that Chang Chü-cheng had worked only for the benefit of Chang Chü-cheng! If for a slight personal advantage he had been willing to sacrifice a former friend and colleague by judicial murder, what else could one have expected from him?
Early that year Wan-li had revoked the Civil Service ranks of Tutor Chang’s three sons. In April 1573, when further conspiracies of Chang with 
Feng Pao were brought to his attention, he decreed that Chang Chü-cheng's title of Grand Preceptor be posthumously eliminated.59 The anti-Chang group then circulated the story that before his death the grand-secretary had actually intrigued to usurp the throne. Ch’i Chi-kuang was to make his army available at the right moment. A provincial examiner in Chang’s confidence had placed before the candidates an essay question which insinuated that the imperial throne belonged to the most virtuous and most talented. This was now construed to have been put forth to test public opinion and to create the atmosphere for an impending takeover. This last news item had disturbed the Wan-li emperor so much that he had the quiz found in the records and showed it to Grand-Secretary Shen Shih-hsing. The latter had considerable difficulty in assuring the sovereign that the essay topic, quoted from classical sources, could not have such implications.
Yet, as more of Chang Chü-cheng’s life was laid bare，the emperor was even less at ease with his ghost. It had become clear that when the grand-secretaiy was alive, he had surrounded himself with cronies who constantly flattered him as a statesman of imperial timber and a leader of majestic vision. Chang，smiling pleasantly，had made no gesture to deny their flattery. His having taken their comments for granted led to the speculation that the imperial throne was indeed what he was aiming for.60 Even such presumptuousness Wan-li might have tolerated. But more unforgivable was the fact that Chang Chü-cheng had also allowed his followers to call him I Yin. Who was I Yin? He was a sagelike statesman in ancient Shang times. Having assisted Ch，eng-t’ang to become ruler of all China, he had held the regency for his heir and grandson, T^i-chia. But as the latter grew immoral, I Yin dethroned him and took over the sovereignty himself. He acted as ruler for three years, returning the throne to T5ai-chia only after the latter had shown repentance and made amends.
With all its insinuations, this stoiy could well cause the Wan-li emperor's face to turn alternatively red and white with humiliation and rage.61 Yet for a time he still tried to forget the whole thing. It was only in May 1584 that he finally authorized the confiscation of Change properties. The action was touched off by an incendiary petition submitted by an imperial princess who charged that when Chang Chü-cheng was alive he had not only wrongly stripped her husband of his aristocratic title but also seized their family estate for personal gain. The emperors order of confiscation, however, involved some technical difYiculties. Almost two years had slipped by since Change death. The decree must produce what had been in his possession as of two years ago and not be limited to what was now found on the deceased’s premises. This meant that an effort had to be made to uncover what was hidden and what had been carried away. In such a case the judiciaiy procedure called for a fair estimate of the assets, based not on evidence but on the general reputation of the accused and his standard of living. His kin must then be forced to make up the difference.62
Now Chang Chü-cheng's high style of living had been so well publicized and the emperor’s anger so inflamed that the officials executing the confiscation order dared not produce less than what seemed to be logically adequate. Chang's house in Peking was assessed at 10,000 ounces of silver. His brother and sons, under arrest in Chiang-ling, had together surrendered assets in excess of 100,000 ounces of silver plus gold and silver jewelry. When more was demanded from them, the eldest son, already badly beaten，confessed that he had indeed hidden three times that amount somewhere. The next morning he was found dead; he had hanged himself. Several days later a household servant followed suit.
Chang’s household goods，loaded on 110 carrying trays，were delivered at the palace. Among the effects were four sheets of calligraphy done by His Majesty the Emperor and given to his cherished tutor several years before to commend his loyalty and devotion. No prizes of excessive value were said to have been produced by the confiscation proceedings. If Wan-li personally checked those effects, his reaction is not recorded. The only perspn who could have interceded in the case was Empress Dowager Tz'u-sheng; apparently she did not make the move. It was about that time when her own father, the marquis of Wu-ch’ing, died. He was posthumously honored as a duke; the aristocratic title was, moreover, inherited by the first son.63 Entirely unprecedented, the conferring of honor to imperial in-laws on such an extravagant scale would never have been possible during the era of Chang Chü-cheng, who, if alive, would certainly have argued against it in the interest of the dynasty.
After the confiscation of family properties，two persons pleaded mercy for Chang's mother. As a result, Wan-li ordered that a cottage along with 160 acres of land be set aside for her use. Yet one of the petitioners, GrandSecretary Shen Shih-hsing, received a mild reprimand from the throne for siding with the Chang family. The other was less fortunate. Minister of Justice Fan Chi-hsiin was subsequently dismissed from the Civil Service for exaggerating the hardships of the Changs.64
Having gone this far，it would have been difficult for the Wan-li emperor to retreat from his position. But there was no basis upon which to build a case of treason or usurpation; nor would such charges serve the interest of
His Majesty the Emperor. A general proclamation was nevertheless required. It came another four months later. In September 1584, after the imperial censorate had listed all the wrong-doings of Chang Chü-cheng, Wan-li declared that his former tutor and grand-secretaiy had abused power, perverted governmental operation, silenced public opinion, and withheld information from the throne. All these，added to gross disloyalty in managing state affairs, would have justified ccthe reopening of his coffin and desecration of his remains.” It was only in consideration for his many years of service that this penalty was omitted. Instead, Change offenses were posted in every corner of the realm. One of his brothers and two sons were exiled to remote frontiers in perpetuity.
With Tutor Chang posthumously disgraced and Big Companion Feng Pao banished, the emperor had fully regained the reins of his government. But soon he was to discover that the freedom of action he had anticipated was as illusory as ever. After all, to become Son of Heaven was to fulfill an institutional requirement only.
What was the true meaning behind this anti— Chang Chü-cheng movement? It gradually became clear to Wan-li that those who spoke against Chang were of two different types. Some of them were of solid character but also very conservative and inflexible. As soon as the case with Chang was settled，they，among them remonstrators who had previously been beaten at the Meridian Gate and were now reinstated, lost no time in memorializing to censure the emperor himself. Now His Majesty was criti_ cized for being extravagant, indolent, pleasure-seeking, and unfair to his wives—for example, in putting Lady Cheng ahead of Lady Wang. They were determined to make him appear anything but himself. There was another group of officials who, also speaking with moral tongue，pretended that they alone had the strength and vision to expose this Chang-Feng combination and to save the throne from the results of its conspiracies. Having eliminated a few top officials whom they disliked，they now busied themselves with clues as to who had married whose cousin and who had been seen with whose household manager, so that the charge of guilt by association could be extended; and in so doing they created more vacancies in the government and at the same time promoted their own influence. This practice came to a halt only after the emperor, smarting from their censure, reversed himself and demoted some of the agitators, reassigning them to remote provinces.
Now in 1587 His Majesty the Wan-li emperor was still only twenty-four years old; but he had been ruler for fifteen years. The time-span seemed even longer because of so many repetitious and tiring routines. A year earlier Lady Cheng, now imperial consort, had given birth to Ch’ang-hsiin. A son born of the woman he loved should have given Wan-li some comfort. But Ch’ang-hsun，called by the courtiers the “third imperial son，” turned out to be a heavy burden ever after his birth. Alert observers could tell that the emperor was either tired or bored or both. He had chosen as essay topic for the last palace examination a theme related to the Taoist doctrine that good government could be maintained while the ruler did nothing.65
Yet his reign, destined to be the longest of the dynasty，still had a long way to go, crowded with many events. The Year of the Pig was only an insignificant interlude. That July the former imperial tutor, Chang Chü-cheng, had been dead exactly five years. It suddenly occurred to Wan-li to ask what had happened to the house in Peking that had been confiscated from Chang's family and was assessed at a value of 10,000 ounces of silver? Was it occupied? By whom? Or had it been sold or rented? He was curious enough to ask the Ministry of Works to give him an answer. But whatever the reply was, it was not entered in the state records. Apparently the chroniclers felt that by merely writing down the emperors questions they had faithfully reported his state of mind. The issue itself was too trivial to merit following up.66
