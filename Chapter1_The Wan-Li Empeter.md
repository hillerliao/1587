Really, nothing of great significance happened in l587,the Year of the Pig. China was not facing a foreign invasion, nor was the country engulfed in a civil war. Even though the capital district did not have sufficient rain during the summer and epidemics broke out in those months, and though drought was reported in Shantung, and flood in South Chihli, and earthquakes took place in Shansi in the autumn, none of these disasters occurred in alarming proportions. For an empire as immense as oursf such minor incidents and setbacks can only be expected. On the whole, the Year of the Pig would go down in history as an indifferent one.

Can we therefore omit that year from history books?

Not quite.

During the year preceding the defeat of the Armada in the Western world, many seemingly unimportant events took place in China that were closely linked to both her past and her future. At the time it was hard to say for certain whether any isolated incident was merely a passing episode or a crucial turning point but in fact these interlinking events made history. Moreover, it is precisely those commonplace occurrences which historians have been inclined to overlook that often reflected the true character of our empire.

Let me begin my account with what happened on March 2, 1587, an ordinary working day.

It was a sunny day. The trees in Peking were still leafless. The ground on the unpaved streets, after intermittent snow in past months, remained frozen. The air was not terribly cold, but it was not yet warm enough to make outdoor work comfortable.

Around lunchtime hundreds of governmental functionaries, civil official as well as army officers on duty with the capital garrison, raced toward the imperial palace. Word had spread that the emperor was to meet his court at noon, The message caught everyone unprepared. The privileged few riding in sedan chairs still had time to tidy their belts and robes during the journey; but the majority, on foot, were too exhausted from the one-mile dash between their offices and the palace to pay attention to such details.

It was unclear how the guards at the Gate of Greater Brilliance came to allow the crowds to enter. Perhaps seeing the swarms of silk-robed officials, they too were convinced that an important state function was at hand. But once past the gate, the crowd entered the Imperial City. By then they must have realized that the courtyard was too quiet for the occasion. No preparations seemed to have been made on and below the towers of the Meridian Gate. The imperial furniture was not on display. There was no bell-ringing or drum-beating. There were not even any extra guards and officials to serve as marshals. Could all this be a mistake?

Apparently someone made an inquiry of the palace eunuchs inside, it was confirmed that indeed the emperor had never ordered the audience. The crowd began to disperse, relieved yet still excited. They could not help spending a good part of that afternoon and evening discussing the ridicu­lous false summons; but no one could explain why he himself had been so credulous.1

The emperor may have found this litlle disturbance not at all unamus­ing. But as sovereign he had to take serious action. Soon his verbal orders were passed to the eunuchs on duty, committed to writing, and directed to the Minister of Rites and the Court of State Ceremonial. These two offices were in charge of ritualistic proceedings, the former for designing them to conform with the cosmic spirit and historical precedents, and the latter for actual coordination. They should have known that an imperial audience had not been held at noon for 160 years and that there was no existing procedural code for it. How could the session have been called for without either preparation or rehearsal? When the rumor of the audience was circuIated, members of these two offices should have helped to clarify the situa­tion and stopped the stampede. For their failure to do so, all of them were to forfeit their salaries for two months. Moreover, an investigation was to be conducted promptly to find out who had first circulated the false message.

The investigation turned out to be inconclusive. The court reported that the whole thing had started with a large number of people simultaneously running toward the palace; it was therefore impossible to pin down the responsibility. Upon receiving this report, the emperor extended the suspension of salary to all governmental functionaries in the capital.

How severe this punishment was might not have been fully realized by the emperor. He had suspended salaries before to penalize officials for dereliction of duty and for submitting irritating memorials to the throne, but such a measure had been applied only to individual. The group penalty covering the entire body of capital officials was unprecedented. Indeed, because emoluments for the bureaucrat authorized by the dynasty were fixed at very low levels, many officials, especially those in the higher ech­elons, did not live on their regular pay. A minister, rank 2a, was entitled to an annual salary of 152 ounces of silver; in practice he might receive cash gifts from provincial governors of ten times that amount on a single occasion. Aware of this custom, the emperor may have imagined that all officials received such perquisites. There was no evidence that he understood the difficulties of the office-holders in the lower ranks, who extended their personal resources to accumulate seniority and wait for provincial assignments, meanwhile often languishing in debt. For a secretary in a ministry, rank 6a, the annual compensation of thirty-five ounces of silver had to be counted as an essential item in the household budget, even though it might not pay the rent. So the harsh punishment must have brought distress to many such households.2

The action taken by the throne was nevertheless considered to be just and final. With all its pomp and grandeur, the imperial court was supposed to preserve its impeccable and meticulous manners as an inspiration of the nation. It was absolutely unbecoming for the entire court to run chaotically toward a wrong destination at a wrong time. Both the sovereign and his bureaucrats realized that to fulfill their functions they had to do well in two areas: personnel management and ceremonial procedure. Of course, not many practical problems could be solved this way, but it was essential to managing an immense empire from one center. There was a limit to the number of practical problems that could be perceived, understood, analyzed, and discharged by our literary bureaucracy that governed many millions of peasants. So discipline and decorum had to be emphasized; the example set by the emperor's court became paramount. Rewards and punishments remained effective means to underline this emphasis.

Having gone this far, it would have been diffiicult for the Wan-li emperor to retreat from his position. But there was no basis upon which to build a case of treason or usurpation; nor would such charges serve the interest of His Majesty the Emperor. A general proclamation was nevertheless required. It came another four months later. In September 1584, after the imperial censorate had listed all the wrong-doings of Chang Chii-cheng, Wan-li declared that his former tutor and grand-sccretary had abused power, perverted governmental operation, silenced public opinion, and withheld information from the throne. All these added to gross disloyalty in managing state affairs, would have justified "thhe reopening of his coffinn and desecration of his remains.” It was only in consideration for his many years of service that this penalty was omitted. Instead, Chang's offenses were posted in every corner of the realm. One of his brothers and two sons were exiled to remote frontiers in perpetuity.



With Tutor Chang posthumously disgraced and Big Companion Feng Pao banished, the emperor had fully regained the reins of his government. But soon he was to discover that the freedom of action he had anticipated was as illusory as ever. After all to become Son of Heaven was to fulfill an institutional requirement only.

What was the true meaning behind this anti-Chang Chii-cheng movement? It gradually became clear to Wan-li that those who spoke against Chang were of two different types. Some of them were of solid character but also very conservative and inflexible. As soon as the case with Chang was settled, they, among them remonstrators who had previously been beaten at the Meridian Gate and were now reinstated, lost no time in memorializing to censure the emperor himself. Now His Majesty was criti­cized for being extravagant, indolent, pleasure-seeking, and unfair to his wives—for example, in putting Lady Cheng ahead of Lady Wang. They were determined to make him appear anything but himself. There was another group of officials who, also speaking with moral tongue, pretended that they alone had the strength and vision to expose this Chang-Feng combination and to save the throne from the results of its conspiracies. Having eliminated a few top oflicials whom they disliked, they now busied themselves with clues as to who had married whose cousin and who had been seen with whose household manager, so that the charge of guilt by association could be extended; and in so doing they created more vacancies in the government and at the same time promoted their own influence. This practice came to a halt only after the emperor, smarting from their censure, reversed himself and demoted some of the agitators, reassigning them to remote provinces.

Now in 1567 His Majesty the Wan-Ii emperor was still only twenty-four years old; but he had been ruler for fifteen years. The time-span seemed even longer because of so many repetitious and tiring routines. A year earlier Lady Cheng, now imperial consort, had given birth to Ch'ang-hsün. A son born of the woman he loved should have given Wan-li some comfort . But Ch'ang-hsün,  called by the courtiers the "third imperial son" turned out to be a heavy burden ever after his birth. Alert observers could tell that the emperor was either tired or bored or both. He had chosen an essay topic for the last palace examination a theme related to the Taoist doctrine that good government could be maintained while the ruler did nothing. 65  

Yet his reign，destined to be the longest of the dynasty，still had a long way to go, crowded with many events. The Year of the Pig was only an insignificant interlude. That July the former imperial tutor, Chang Chü-cheng, had been dead exactly five years. It suddenly occurred to Wan-Ii to ask what had happened to the house in Peking that had been confiscated from Chang's family and was assessed at a value of 10,000 ounces of silver? Was it occupied? By whom? Or had it been sold or rented? He was curious enough to ask the Ministry of Works to give him an answer. But whatever the reply was, it was not entered in the state records. Apparently the chroniclers felt that by merely writing down the emperor's questions they had faithfully reported his state of rnind. The issue itself was too trivial to merit following up.66
