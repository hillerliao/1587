In a world without Chang Chii-cheng the empire began to slide slowly but irrevocably into an abyss. It eventually found itself in a constitutional deadlock the breaking of which was beyond any human powers. At first the crisis was not even recognized. But as months stretched into years and years into decades, each worsening turn of events marked a point of no return. As an emperor who actually carried on a strike against his own bureaucrats over a long period of time, Wan-li has come down in history without any close parallel. He was vengeful because his courtiers frustrated his desire to make his third son his heir at the expense of his first, thus hurting the woman he loved. He was cynical because he knew that everyone else, like him, harbored his hidden yin behind his professed yang. Yet despite all these feelings Wan-li made no plans to abdicate or，on the other hand, to force his own wishes on his court. He did not even publicly announce his intention of making his third son heir, although to others it was as clear as though it were written. As a result, no attempt was made to impeach him; no civil war broke out; there was no rebellion. Yet for well over a decade the sovereign continued to engage in this odd struggle of endurance with the civil officials. If they would not let him install Ch’ang-hsiin as his successor, he in turn would not authorize the investiture of Ch’ ang-lo as heir designate. In fact，he even refused to let the eldest imperial son be capped and introduced to the Han-lin academicians for his education.
In the end Wan-li had to yield to public opinion, but grudgingly and most bitterly. When the eldest imperial son was finally designated his successor and the third son, Prince Fu, sent off to a provincial home, the wound thus inflicted did not heal—nor would it heal during the rest of His Majesty’s long reign. Never again would the occupant of the throne consent to perform his duties as the bureaucrats wanted him to, in ways that only served their interests. He remained emperor, with the prerogatives due him, but he refused to do one more thing to satisfy the civil officials. For decades court rituals，if conducted at all，had to proceed without the ruler’s presence. The emperor derived a malicious satisfaction from leaving numerous high-ranking positions inside and outside the capital unfilled, so that civil officials, with a few exceptions, were denied opportunities to be promoted to the very top of the hierarchy. He chose to ignore the bureaucrats’ protests, because he knew that if he acted on their remonstrating papers, either coolly or heatedly, the petitions and his own rescripts would be turned over to the supervising secretaries’ office for publication. This in fact would serve the purpose of the remonstrators, as they would earn a righteous reputation because of their criticism and defiance of the throne, while the throne would again be exposed in a bad light. So a better way of handling those irritating memorials was to bury them in a pile of wastepaper.
Under the circumstances, responsible officials with clear consciences were compelled to resign. But the emperor's reply to a request for resignation could also inadvertently give the petitioner a chance to air his grievance; so those requests were similarly pigeon-holed. A handful of officials, angry and desperate, left without authorization. Nor would the emperor follow the advice of the Ministry of Personnel to press charges against the deserters. During the later years of Wan-li, a position unoccupied became a position lost by default on the part of the bureaucrat concerned.
Classical canons, with which both the sovereign and his courtiers were of course familiar, sanctioned revolt against a ruler who was brutal and committed gross atrocities against his subjects. But neither ancient sages nor historical references offered guidance in a situation where a ruler selectively and quietly ignored some of his duties, and in doing so was literally following the Taoist doctrine of inaction.
Inasmuch as the Civil Service was a self-perpetuating body, most of its functions were carried on as usual. Palace examinations took place in the Years of the Ox, the Dragon, the Ram, and the Dog. It was also in those years that provincial officials were evaluated. The evaluation of capital officials in the Years of the Snake and the Pig completed the cycle. Starting from the reign of Wan-li, the appointment of officials to middle- and junior-grade positions, including those who were transferred, promoted, and demoted, was decided by drawing lots. The Ministry of Personnel listed all the vacant positions of the same rank and matched them with an equal number of eligible candidates. Except for the rulings that no one was to be appointed to serve in his native province or to become a superior or subordinate to his own kin, the details were left to chance. To those matters in which official personnel were handled in bulk the emperor gave his routine approval, generally allowing trusted eunuchs to wield the vermilion brushes for him.1
After reigning for forty-eight years, the Wan-li emperor died peacefully and was buried, along with his empress and Lady Wang, in the mausoleum that he himself had helped to design. The woman he loved, Lady Cheng, was left behind to outlive him for ten years. Accused of every sort of intrigue and considered a curse on the empire, she was forced to spend her old age in a desolate lodge within the Forbidden City, separated forever from her beloved son, Prince Fu, cause of all the controversy. The prince's land grant in excess of 600,000 acres remained another source of widespread irritation. None of the bureaucrats even bothered to explain to the public that the so-called fief existed only on paper, and that the bulk of reported acreage, grossly exaggerated, had actually been converted into an annual stipend of some 20,000 ounces of silver, in accordance with the dynasty’s practice.2
Paradoxically, once the succession had become a settled issue, debate on the conditions that had led up to it, taking place after the emperor's death, paralyzed the court more than the issue itself had done. Now every reference to the past was bitterly debated and fought over. The court, already split into factions, had numerous accounts to be settled, most of them of merely the slightest significance. In several decades the Wan-li emperor had through his negligence and omissions done the bureaucracy irreparable damage.
His Majesty, being ruler, was expected to fulfill this role by presiding over the civil officials impartially. Even if Wan-li had worked earnestly he might still have had to face insurmountable difficulties. Fundamentally he had to cater to the dual character of the bureaucrats, to provide them with materialistic incentives as well as nurture their spiritual growth. Not only were these two objectives divergent in purpose, but the only means to achieve a balance between them that lay at the throne’s disposal were abstract and indirect at best, limited as they were to personnel management and ceremonial proceedings. Moreover, after the controversial management of Chang Chii-cheng, the seeds of distrust had already been sown among the bureaucrats.
In practice, the emperor did precisely the opposite to what was required of him. Bent on being uncooperative, he virtually eliminated a number of prestigious government positions, dampening the hopes of many officials who had counted on their meritorious service to enable them to reach the highest rung of success, thereby enriching themselves and glorifying their ancestors. Skeptical as he was, the monarch did not even pretend to perform his duties according to moral law. Numerous individuals who remained loyal to the throne must have inwardly felt the futility of their own blind devotion.
So the outward tranquility of the Civil Service was indeed misleading. With no sense of cohesion it became a turbulent body. Unless its members could strive to equip themselves with some measure of mental alertness and voluntary exertion, their perfunctory and indirect writing of memorandums could not hope to dissolve the numerous discrepancies or bridge the many technical gaps within the gigantic network of bureaucratic offices. During a great part of His Majesty’s reign of forty-eight years, when the top of the hierarchy, in despair, found that central leadership did not exist, cynicism and slack discipline spread through all the ranks. The diligent had less reason to maintain their diligence; the corrupt, on the other hand, had a better chance to indulge their corruption. The decline of the overall performance of the bureaucracy was steady and gradual. If the dynasty did not collapse at this point it was largely because no alternative to it existed. In an immense yet noncompetitive empire such as ours, the establishment continued to exist through mere inertia.
The atmosphere was depressing，to say the least. A group of bureaucrats,  later known as Tung-lin partisans, nevertheless refused to give up. They believed that moral leadership could be established outside the monarchy. Cultured gentlemen, they were obliged to hold fast to what they had learned from the Four Books and Chu Hsi. Their classical education ordained them to be active and unyielding. Labeling themselves as ”good elements,” some of them managed to enter the Ministry of Personnel and the censorial-supervising branch of the government. They immediately put their moral perception to work by purging these offices of the ”bad elements,” 55 including persons whom they regarded as acting apathetic and indolent during the scheduled personnel evaluations. As long as their program did not touch the emperor himself, it was routinely approved.
But this effort at moral reformation without the sovereign’s active direction only rendered a disservice to the Civil Service as a whole. The ruler as a human being could not perform better than anyone else. But as the Son of Heaven he had at his command the mystique of the throne. As he was thought to be impartial, his human and technical errors could be overlooked. Even an act of injustice meted out by him would elicit protest but not retaliation. The Tung-lin partisans never held the advantage. In an age when 20,000 gentlemen dressed in service robes already found it difficult to reach a consensus as to what was right and what was wrong in conducting their affairs, the championing of an absolute standard no less ambiguous and abstract and set by some two dozen no less human individuals with their own petty aims and personal ties was not likely to win general approval. To counter the purges threatened by the Tung-lin, their rivals also formed blocs and cliques in the name of morality, until everyone had to take sides in order to survive.
The death of the emperor actually removed the last obstacle to open feud between the rival partisans. The question was now raised as to why, when Wan-li was still indecisive on the succession issue, the top bureaucrats had not spoken up more vigorously. Had Wang Hsi-chiieh, who later became first grand-secretaiy, agreed to some compromise that had actually encouraged the emperor to hold out? What about the story that Lady Cheng had made an attempt on the heir designated life? And what about those two eunuchs who had master-minded the unsuccessful plot? Had her brother been involved? Emotionally loaded but factually vague and legally ambiguous, these questions were often asked without a genuine desire to find answers. In fact, none was ever offered. They were fired back and forth between opposing camps like accusations. The ultimate purpose was to advance partisan interests by conveniently putting the enemy camp on the defensive.
The dynasty was even less prepared for partisan politics. With a hopelessly undeveloped judiciary system, the machinery required to conduct arbitration over conflicting claims was wanting. Even technical problems brought before the emperors court had to be reduced to moral archetypes of perfect good and absolute evil before they could be deliberated upon. Only when thousands of hidden motives and private interests had been restrained and neutralized by the teachings of the Four Books could the empire be held together. The moment the bureaucrats started to quote the text of the canon to wage a verbal civil war, the most vital organizational principle was abandoned. Clearly, when the bureaucracy began to disintegrate the empire became ungovernable. And this conclusion could have been drawn long before 1620 when the Wan-li emperor’s body was carried to Ta-yii-shan for burial. A little over three decades before, in 1587, a year of no significance, his grand-secretary, Shen Shih-hsing, had already predicted that under such conditions the state could not long remain in peace and order.
But Grand-Secretary Shen had commanded little influence in shaping public opinion in his own day, let alone afterward. Because the succession issue began to emerge as a serious problem while he was master of the Literary Depth Pavilion, the fact that he occupied that position for several crucial years was later much deplored. He was regarded as having been too weak and pliant. Also, he was accused of having encouraged Wan-li to put aside remonstrating papers unread and not acted upon.
When he was forced from office in 1591, the Year of the Rabbit, Shen carried no public sympathy with him. In early 1590, the Year of the Tiger, the first imperial son，Ch’ang-lo, had reached age ten by Chinese count, though his actual age was only eight-and-a-half. The fact that he had not yet been initiated for formal education under the tutorship of the Han-lin academicians caused the civil officials considerable anxiety, as they feared he would grow up without the ability to communicate with the court. But unless a princely title was conferred upon him, no ritualistic proceedings could provide for him to meet his tutors and no initiation could take place. In an attempt to right this situation, the civil officials exerted great pressure on the four grand-secretaries, who were required to urge Wan-li promptly to install Ch5ang-lo as imperial heir. They, Shen Shih-hsing included, duly submitted their resignations to the emperor and threatened to leave office unless this demand was met.3
Faced with this ultimatum, Wan-li replied that he had no desire to change the order of succession; yet the tactic of exerting pressure on him to act on a matter that lay within his own prerogative he must resist. He would, he promised, install his eldest son as imperial heir in early 1592, the Year of the Dragon, provided that in the interim no one would bother him about the matter of succession again. Should silence on the issue be violated，he warned，the installation would again be postponed. With this agreement the grand-secretaries had to return to their desks.
The following year was tense. There was a general suspicion that Shen Shih-hsing, who now enjoyed an intimate relationship with the throne, might be bribed by the emperor to use his influence to steer public opinion to favor Ch'ang-hsiin over his elder brother, especially when, in the spring of 1591, Wan-li first offered to make Shen Grand Preceptor and then to confer on him the stipend due an earl—both rare honors far beyond ordinary awards and promotions.4 Even though in each case Shen Shih-hsing declined vigorously and frantically until the offer was withdrawn, he was embarrassed and thrown into a state of consternation by it. Unknowingly, by his magnanimous gestures Wan-li had reduced Shen’s effectiveness as a liaison between officials and the throne. Despite his mild and gentle disposition, Shen was feared as a potential king-maker as well as in his position as chief counsellor to the sovereign. Once again he was exposed to the criticisms of the censorial officials. In September 1591, even a provincial official from Fukien memorialized the throne to censure Shen Shih-hsing for suppressing a report that underground water was seeping from the floors of the emperors mausoleum, the construction of which had been under Shen’ s supervision for six years.5 Was it necessary for this minor functionary more than a thousand miles away to risk his position for such a small detail? The censure nevertheless served as a warning to the first grand-secretary that even though he enjoyed imperial trust he was by no means unaccountable to his fellow officials. In this particular case the memorialist was briefly dismissed from the Civil Service for his unwar-ranted accusation. Yet, his purpose already accomplished, he could expect to be recalled in the future, perhaps with added glory and prestige.
In October, with 1592 only months away, a secretary with the Ministry of Works，completely within his jurisdiction, submitted a budgetary request to the emperor for the pending installation of the heir designate. The imperial rescript on this petition turned out to be a shock to the courtiers. Wan-li seized upon the memorial as an infraction of his edict of silence on the succession issue and therefore felt justified in postponing the installation ceremony. How could someone who showed such lack of faith be the Ruler of All Men? Responsible officials in the court felt obliged to urge the emperor to honor his pledge. On the day they did so, Shen Shih-hsing was on sick leave. The joint petition of the grand-secretaries was drafted by Hsii Kuo, second in command, without his knowledge. Hsii nevertheless included Shen’s name on the paper just before his own.6
When he learned of the petition, Shen Shih-hsing wrote a confidential note to the emperor, using a special kind of stationery. In his effort to soothe the sovereign, he pointed out that he himself had not even been consulted before the petition was submitted. Wan-li then rescripted that he appreciated Tutor Shen’s kindness. The matter could have ended there. Standard practice demanded that a confidential note submitted by a grand-secretary, after being read by the emperor, should be returned to the writer and not be circulated. As it happened, this particular note was intercepted by Hsii Kuo, who routinely sent it to the supervising secretaries' office to be entered into the public record. Shen Shih-hsing was able to retrieve it from the file before copies had been made but not before its contents were known to many. To remove a document from the offices at the Meridian Gate, moreover, was in itself a violation of procedure, which constrained the supervising secretary in charge to impeach Shen. The first grand-secretary was said “to have openly supported public opinion in favor of the immediate installation of the imperial heir, yet privately to have maneuvered to impede action so that he could court personal favor.” The impeachment then continued: ”After using evasive words to betray his friends, he resorted to a confidential note to misguide his master. If Your Majesty should ever be so lenient as to spare his life, the spirit of our dynastic founder would assuredly deliver him to his deserved destruction.”
These harsh words ended a splendid career of twenty-nine years that had started with the winning of first place at the Civil Service examinations and had endured hundreds of rounds of kowtowing on the granite yard outside the Literary Floral Hall.
Even at this point the Wan-li emperor did not grasp the serious nature of the case. He ordered that the supervising secretary who had submitted the impeachment order be demoted and transferred to a provincial post and urged Tutor Shen to return to office, which the latter consented to do. But a wave of protest engulfed the court and it became clear that the first grand-secretary’s usefulness to the throne had already been destroyed. What defenses Shen Shih-hsing could rally for the confidential nature of his note and the factual truth it represented, both of a technical nature, could never provide him with immunity against the charge of duplicity, a fatal moral accusation that lay beyond procedural considerations. In a sense, the emperor’s chief counsellor had already been tried by public opinion and found guilty. The consensus of the court was so clear that, having been given a vote of nonconfidence, Shen Shih-hsing could no longer even be retained by imperial authority. He had no alternative other than to tender the throne his resignation repeatedly until his involuntary retirement was finally authorized. If he stayed on, he would become another Chang Chii-cheng.
The discharging of the emperor’s first grand-secretary was not unaccompanied by other dismissals. In his wrath Wan-li withdrew his order of demotion and transfer of the supervising secretary involved, stripped him of his Civil Service status, and made him a commoner — ostensibly because of his violation of the imperial demand for silence on the succession issue, but in reality because he had been openly praised by subsequent memorialists as their hero; they were now petitioning the throne to retain him in the capital. The next day His Majesty also accepted the resignation of Second Grand-Secretaiy Hsii Kuo. For many years Hsu had been thought to be close to Shen Shih-hsing; now it was revealed that intense rivaliy and contention must have existed between them. His deliberate disclosure of Shen’s confidential note could never escape the criticism of being malicious. It was evident that a person of such character should not be retained within the inner circle of the throne. Once his de facto dismissal went into effect, the emperor waited two more days to accept with sincere regret the request for retirement by his beloved Tutor Shen.7
The tragedy of the Year of the Rabbit was that nobody emerged a victor. The succession issue, which had kindled the round of controversy and produced casualties at the top level, could not for some time be comfortably brought up by the courtiers. Because of the woman he loved, the emperor was not ready to surrender his personal wish, which, in the light of the public opinion so unmistakably expressed during the recent confrontations, could not be attained without resorting to force—and that, for better or worse, could never be the sovereign's choice, as it contradicted his Buddhist inclinations.
In his handling of the succession issue Wan-li had blundered badly. The inevitable consequence of his making Lady Cheng imperial consort was that Ch’ang-hsiin, his son by her, would rank higher than Ch’ang-lo, given birth by Lady Wang three and a half years earlier, since his second son had died prematurely. Yet Wan-li had no moral justification for favoring one son over another; so he resorted to procrastination. First he refused to designate Ch'ang-lo as his heir on the grounds that he was too young and delicate to fulfill the ceremonial requirements that would be expected of him. Then he said that he resented being pushed into action by his subjects. As a matter of principle he refused to do what he was told. In between times he himself came up with the proposal that he confer the title of prince on all three of his sons equally. When that was not endorsed by the civil officials, he retreated to the position that his empress was still young enough to give him another son，so that the entire business of designating an heir could be postponed. These inconsistencies exposed not only the sovereign’s lack of good faith but also his lack of courage, which naturally strengthened the opposition.8
The deadlock soon became a constitutional crisis because no legal apparatus existed to break it- One little_known point was that the emperor’s wish to make his third son his heir rather than his first was not without justification from the standpoint of statutory or customaiy law. Had the empire been governed by an independent judiciary and the throne submitted its proposal to the court, and had his wish been candidly presented and vigorously argued by jurists, chances are that the sovereign’s case against the bureaucrats would have been won.
First of all，Ch’ang-lo could not be said to have a right to succession. Nobody had. Until an emperor’s son had the title of prince conferred upon him, he was technically a commoner. If there had been such a thing as birthright, this rule would have been superfluous. Second, primogeniture was a social norm of ceremonial custom, not a binding rule on the imperial family. This fact was amply confirmed by the successful rebellion of Prince Yen，the dynasty’s third emperor. As a fourth son he had not only dislodged a nephew born of his eldest brother, but also, by seizing the throne for himself, he had disregarded the priority of the heirs of his other two elder brothers. Third, the dynastic founder's instructions on the succession issue did declare that sons born of an emperor’s secondary wives must follow age sequence. However, a son born of the empress was not bound by this restriction; he took priority over his half brothers, older or younger.9 Since Ch'ang-hsiin was born of an imperial consort, who ranked next only to the empress, his case could have been considered exceptional. And fourth, if Wan-li had wished it, there was nothing to prevent him from deposing Empress Hsiao-tuan and replacing her with Lady Cheng, thus raising Ch’ang-hsiin’s status. In the history of the dynasty, four emperors had deposed their empresses and elevated secondary wives of their choice to the vacated position. All that was necessary was the emperor's own order, which in none of these cases had been resisted.10
Why did Wan-li not clearly announce his intention from the beginning and firmly declare that the succession issue lay within the domain of his own prerogative and was therefore not a matter open for public discussion? No single answer will suffice. But fundamentally, His Majesty^ realm had never been legally structured in such a way as to enable him to make such a claim. Rather, it was governed directly by the moral law proclaimed in the Four Books. From their classical education, including historical lessons, the entire population had learned that fathers must be impartial to their sons, that elder brothers were supposed to command and lead their younger brothers, and that men of rectitude should never be swayed by the influence of women to modify their public obligations because of private sentiments. These tenets had been repeatedly cited in every school in every village and even passed on to the illiterate to keep the empire in order. Had legal technicalities been permitted to override these tenets, the organizational logic of the empire would have been challenged and the magistrates would never again have been able to manage the affairs of their counties. The entire bureaucracy had simply never been educated or accustomed to accept that kind of government.
In short，Wan-li’s desire to depart from custom was not so much illegal in terms of statutory law as it was unethical in the eyes of orthodox bureaucrats. The weight of public opinion nevertheless compelled him to deny what he actually had in mind, and at times even to pay lip service to the principle of primogeniture. But once he had recognized the succession as a moral issue, that recognition nullified all the legal arguments that would have been in his favor.
Continuing to cherish a personal wish that was now unmentionable, the sovereign also suffered from lack of counsel. Until the day he died，the Wan-li emperor was destined to be a lonely man. Undoubtedly he had hoped to draw Shen Shih-hsing to his side, the only individual over whom he might exert some personal influence. Yet, because even in private he could not admit his true intention and disclose his strategy, he had no way of advancing his cause. No counsellor of his, principled or unprincipled, could have taken a stand on his behalf. On the contrary, one first grand- secretaiy after another felt compelled to act not as an agent of the throne but as a spokesman for the bureaucrats，who were demanding that the sovereign clarify his position and rectify himself. When their efforts produced no results, one after another they had to leave office under public pressure. As a result, Wan-li had to deal with several first grand-secretaries of varying temperaments. His ad hoc maneuvers with these diverse personalities exposed his inconsistency more than ever.
Faced with such a hopeless situation, Wan-li's unwillingness to abandon his desire to place Chang-hsiin on the throne led to the widespread speculation that he might have been forced by Lady Cheng to act the way he did against his own better judgment. For some time the courtiers had also suspected that the sovereign and his favorite concubine were waiting for the death of the empress, who was then said to be in very poor health. At this point no one could have anticipated, of course, that Empress Hsiao- tuan was to live for many more decades, and eventually when her death did come，that it would be followed four months later by the emperor’s.
But amid all the confusion and intrigue a most important developmertt that was taking place went virtually unnoticed: the changing character of the monarchy as an institution prior to and during His Majesty’s reign. Wan-li occupied the same dragon seat his ancestors had; however, he was required to rule with fewer human qualities and less personal passion. Unlike his ancestors who, with little or no accuracy, had been lavishly described by the literary-educational officials of their day as paragons of virtue, this latter-day emperor was carefully tutored by the corresponding officials to cast his life into the mold created for him. The difference was subtle, but the essence of it was that, when the dynasty was established, the emperors proceeded to build up the bureaucracy as an instrument of the  
state to cany out their ideas of administration, whereas two hundred years later, the bureaucracy, now firmly established, needed only a cloistered sovereign to act as its presiding officer, whose impartiality was deemed far more important than his ability to command.
With all their talk of the sovereign’s responsibility to heaven, the sixteenth-century bureaucrats were actually preventing him from becoming actively involved in the matters brought to the throne for disposal. He was encouraged to be emotionally neutral and personally bland. There was little chance for him to become responsive to state affairs in any functional way. In short, an effort to dehumanize the monarchy was under way, against which the occupant of the throne had no defense. Evidently this milieu first caused the Wan-li emperor, who since childhood had been taught to take rather than give orders，to hesitate to assert himself on the succession issue, and later, when bitter experience enabled him to see the inner mechanism of his court, to feel totally alienated from it.
The trouble was that while the emperor chose to suspend the issue of the imperial heir, the bureaucrats were growing restless. Since 1587, the Year of the Pig, no other issue had attracted so much attention and rocked the court of Peking so profoundly as the matter of succession. Neither the rebellion of Yang Ying-lung in the southwest, nor the revolt of Piibei in the northwest, the invasion of Korea by Hideyoshi, or even the empire-building of Nurhaci had generated the degree of anger and concern on the part of the 2,000 silk-robed gentlemen in the capital as the question of who should succeed His Majesty on the dragon seat did.
Even after Ch’ang-lo was installed as heir designate and Ch’ang-hsiin sent to Honan, the case was by no means settled. As long as the notorious Lady Cheng was keeping company with the sovereign day and night, alternating her allure with termagancy, what abominable act was she incapable of trapping him into? The angry officials ardently wished there was some way Lady Cheng could be impeached.11 Without naming names，several memorials to the emperor in fact pointed out to His Majesty that an upright ruler should never subject himself to the spell of beautiful women. Historically they were the kind of temptation that ruined dynasties.12
There were rumors, rumors of all kinds, and rumors that contradicted one another. There were rumors suggesting palace intrigues that involved murder and sorceiy, and rumors involving delightful stories of human interest. As always, men were predisposed to believe whatever reinforced their wishful thinking and to pass along whatever helped to relieve their fear and anxiety. Rumors therefore served useful purposes at this time.
EfYlgies were said to have been found in the palace. According to popular tradition, when an image of one’s enemy was stabbed with a new pin on every seventh day by an expert specialized in the craft, the victim would be afflicted with an unknown ailment for which even the best physicians could find no cure. Was Lady Cheng trying to do this to Ch'ang-lo? Soon it was being said that the empress's effigy was found; and then, even more alarmingly, that of the emperor.
In those frantic days a certain grand-secretary was continuing his calm practice of bowing down before a wooden board fastened on the doorway to his office. He had posted that board inside the Literary Depth Pavilion as a reminder to himself not to do ten things that he believed would injure the population and therefore provoke the displeasure of heaven. Every morning he paused in front of his own ten commandments before attending to his desk. Though in the past the eccentric act had been ignored, now it was reported to the emperor that the grand-secretary was practicing witchcraft, as he had been observed cursing in front of a tablet with dubious writing on it. The emperor was concerned enough to have the board brought to the palace for his personal scrutiny before reprimanding the eunuch who had called this bit of hearsay to his attention.13
Some of these circulating stories in time became part of history. One of these related that when Lady Wang first met the emperor she was already past her most flourishing years, and subsequently she developed a cataract on one of her eyes. This was an explanation of why she had first infatuated the emperor yet in the end lost his favor. Another story had it that once Wan-li was ill and thought he was dying, only to wake up and find himself lying in Lady Wang’s arms, her face streaked with tears.14 Meanwhile Lady Cheng was nowhere to be found. Naturally, she was such a heartless woman! Still another stoiy involved Empress Dowager Tz’u-sheng. It was said that she was dismayed by the emperor's intention of cutting off the right to succession of her eldest grandson, Ch^ng-lo. The following conversation was supposed to have taken place between her and Wan-li:
Empress dowager: Lefs face it. What will people think about all this? What are you going to tell them?
Emperor： ril just say, well, that he is only a son born of a chambermaid.
Empress dowager: How dare you! DonJt you know that you yourself are only a son born of a chambermaid?!
According to the stoiy, at this point the emperor had to kowtow and apologize to his mother.15
Most of these stories could not be verified. Despite this, all of them, including the one implying that Lady Wang was much older than the emperor, were eventually engraved on plates and printed for public distribution. Centuries later, Lady Wang5s tombstone inscription nevertheless testified that she was born in early 1565; this would have made her sixteen years old when she first met the emperor, then only eighteen himself.
The fact that block printing was in wide public use during the Wan-li emperor’s reign added a disturbing element to those decades of anxiety. Anonymous pamphlets and pseudonymous literature appeared in Peking to stir up and intensify the controversy. One of these pamphlets asserted that a movement to depose Ch’ang-lo as the designated heir and recall Ch'ang-hsiin to replace him was imminent. The publication also named responsible officials of the court as belonging to the pro—Lady Cheng group that was supposed to carry out the impending coup. When the emperor ordered the Secret Police to arrest the author as well as the publisher of the pamphlet, the search threw the capital into turmoil, inflaming both those whose names appeared in the pamphlet and those whose names did not.16
Few of the people involved in the controversy at the time understood that although the succession issue had crossed the path of their lives by chance, their overreaction to it reflected their own sense of insecurity and the intense rivalries existing among themselves, which had nothing to do with primogeniture. Even without Lady Wang and Lady Cheng, even without the Tung-lin partisans, the bureaucracy had long been approaching an unmanageable state. The unidentified cause of the contention among the civil officials went deeper than any of them realized. It could be traced all the way back to the founding of the dynasty.
A fact often overlooked by contemporaries was that the dynasty's reliance on ideology as an instrument of government was in many respects unprecedented, both in intensity and in scope. Ideology worked well in the early years, especially after the dynastic founder, the Hung-wu emperor, systematically destroyed the empire’s large landowners and wealthy households and imposed a stringently puritanical standard of living on the rest of the educated elite, insisting that they were civil servants of the general population in the literal sense of the word servant. In an atmosphere of rustic simplicity, the gap between an individuaFs inner urge for self-gain and his professed moral standards could be minimized, or at least prevented from appearing to be a cause of concern to the administration.17
By the time Chang Chii-cheng took over the reins of the government on behalf of the Wan-li emperor in 1572, the dynasty had already run a course of two hundred years. At this later date the civil officials were definitely not servants to the agrarian masses. Discrepancies between the earlier ideal and the present reality were many. Among them the most troublesome was that many problems could no longer be handled by practical means. Numerous business proceedings that should have been carried out according to organizational principles were actually handled by the personal touch. One of the reasons for this was that, at the outset, the state settled for a level of income too low to finance its operations throughout an immense empire. The salary scale of the Civil Service was set so low that many officials were virtually unpaid.
Although it recognized these undesirable conditions, the court in the later period was helpless to provide a fundamental cure for them. The dynasty had followed the vision of the Four Books too closely to consider other approaches. Adjudging simple living a permanent national characteristic, the bureaucratic apparatus had deliberately been constructed to avoid technical complexities. It was a huge web, centrally controlled and of enormous dimensions but with little depth and focus, and still less adaptability. No provision had been made within it to handle an expanding budget and adjustable incomes. The Civil Service had neither the administrative expertise nor the necessary service facilities to allow itself to keep pace with a national economy that was expanding in both size and degree of sophistication.18
Impelled by necessity, behind-the-scenes magistrates in many districts had started to collect supplementary payments from the populace in the name of customary fees，which varied in amount and nature from one county to another. Basically, the magistrate added a percentage on taxes collected in silver in the name of melting charges and demanded extras on those items collected in kind in the name of samples and wastages. The community also took care of the magistrate^ housekeeping expenses, supplying him with food, wine, and even gifts to his superiors and colleagues. Connived at by the central authority but never given formal recognition, the twilight legality of such impositions naturally led to abuse. Tax quotas, furthermore, differed widely from region to region. A small percentage on the proceeds from a rich county kept the magistrate amply provided. The same sum would nevertheless be an extortionate drain on a poor county. The ambiguities had rendered the honor code irrelevant. Should a county  
magistrate, who by official order was entitled to an annual compensation of less than thirty ounces of silver, still be considered honest if he helped himself to 300 ounces, but not if he took 3,000? If he appropriated 5 percent of the districfs gross tax proceeds, or 10 percent? At what point was honesty defined?19
Still more ambiguous was the integrity of the capital officials. Denied access to customaiy fees, many of them nevertheless received subsidies from provincial and local officials in the form of cash gifts. The inflow of silver to Peking was so routine that Hai Jui cynically called the years when the evaluation of provincial officials was due “the years when capital officials collected their mortgage payments.”20 What，then，was all this talk about honesty and corruption, when those who were making the character assessments were being paid by the subjects under evaluation? This institutional weakness helped to ruin the personal reputations of many an administrator, including Chang Chii-cheng.
Worse yet, from an organizational point of view, administrators at nearly all levels were not equipped to handle problems arising from changing circumstances. Nor, evidently, had they exercised sufficient control over their subordinates, when the latter had to pay themselves and the power of appointment and dismissal rested with the emperor’s court. The system therefore forced officials to find remedies in personal exertion and moral value. Indeed, the appeal of self-sacrifice to a cultured gentleman produced many a heroic act in the dynasty's annals. There were officials who, although literati never militarily trained, commanded hastily organized defensive forces on city walls and fought fierce battles to the death. There were also officials who ate and slept with common laborers, refusing shelter and braving epidemics to secure river dikes in the face of threatening floods. But what efficiency they did demonstrate had to be drawn entirely from the spiritual lessons of the Four Books and was all they had at their command to apply to emergency situations. The demand for ideology thus tended to spiral upward in an age when technical and organizational solutions to problems should have been being sought and provided.
The result was polarization of the dual character of the bureaucracy. Because on the one hand it persistently pushed the scholar-officials toward the doctrine of compassion and seeking virtue as its own reward, yet on the other hand its organizational inadequacies offered them every opportunity for unearned self-gain, the Civil Service found it increasingly difficult to maintain its balance. The yin and the yang were moving farther away from each other on the spectrum.
This was a problem Chang Chu-cheng had been unable to solve. Though he worked in the Literary Depth Pavilion for a decade, he barely assessed the situation. In fiscal administration the best he could do was to demand the payment of the existing quotas; yet the pressure he applied to the bureaucracy to this end was felt to be unbearable. The silver bullion he accumulated, prodigious as it seemed, was insufficient to fill up the organizational vacuum or to enable him to plan for a major reform. He certainly would not have hoarded the cash deposits in the treasuries if means could have been found to invest them.
After Chang Chu-cheng failed, his successor, Shen Shih-hsing, had to lower his sights drastically. When Shen said that he wished to provide something for virtuous men to rely on and the evil-minded to be afraid of, he was trying to reconcile the two extremes: he would neither strictly enforce the honor code nor encourage abuses. The first grand-secretary never intended his personnel evaluation of 1587, the most lenient on record, to be aimed at relaxation of moral discipline for its own sake. As far as he could see, an extraordinaiy situation had now come to exist which demanded that he abandon the moral rule to respect his sister-in-law at a distance. The time had come for him to grab her in order to save her from drowning.21
There is no evidence that he succeeded. Shen himself was called a great compromiser who moved his head in one direction and his tail in another. The feebleness with which he conducted the evaluation program was challenged by a hard core of young officials, among them an inconspicuous figure, Ku Hsien-ch'eng by name. At that time Shen Shih-hsing had no difficulty transferring his critic to a remote provincial post. Ku Hsien-ch’eng was nevertheless to reemerge later as a prime organizer of the Tung-lin movement, which, with its singleminded drive toward purification, stopped at nothing short of tearing apart the very organization that Shen Shih-hsing had tried to patch up.22
So, around the Year of the Pig, before the full impact of the succession issue had been felt, the internal relationships of the bureaucracy were already seriously strained, as neither the application of pressure from the top nor the call for reconciliation from the middle had actually helped. Civil officials in Peking regarded one another with hostility and suspicion. Some were upstarts who wanted to achieve a life of luxury in a hurry. Others came from well-to-do families who, having chosen to forgo the materialistic gains from office, demanded that others do the same. The text of the Four Books could be taken literally and devoutly, or eclectically and skeptically. Still others, regardless of family background, were undecided and wavering, or else unconscioiasly motivated by personal ties. Once such individual differences were transformed into moral issues, the resulting conflicts became highly charged with emotion. There was a special kind of bigotry afoot that incited a bureaucrat to feel angiy and ashamed of the silk-robed creature next to him, who seemed to have disgraced the mandarin square and the looplike service belt. Yet, prejudice could also come from the other direction. And such bigotiy and prejudice were reinforced by the thousands of petty causes of bickering in daily life.
The succession issue, however, was by no means either petty or abstract. In a practical sense imperial succession became a problem only when two candidates were competing for the throne. But once the issue was settled and one of the contenders emerged as the next ruler, he would, in order to justify his position as the Son of Heaven and in the name of morality, be obliged to punish those who had either overtly or tacitly supported his rival in the past. Without such drastic actions the absolute authority of the throne, already lessened by the competition itself, would never be restored.
This situation had occurred twice before in the dynasty’s history. The third Ming emperor, Yung-lo, had started a rebellion against his nephew and in the course of time was forced to challenge the latter’s right to succession. After seizing the throne, he meted out the death penalty to many who had been unenthusiastic in acknowledging him as the heaven- mandated ruler.23 The sixth emperor，Cheng-t’ung，ha卩 been captured by the Mongols during an ill-conceived military compaign. He was later released by his captors because the court of Peking, with the empress dowager’s approval，during the interim had installed his half-brother as the Ching-t’ai emperor in order to nullify the Mongolian advantage in negotiation while they held the reigning emperor as hostage. Upon his return, Cheng-t’ung lived peacefully in a villa within the Imperial City for seven years; yet in the end his supporters staged a coup to restore him as the legitimate ruler. When this was accomplished, those who had previously been instrumental in Ching-t，ai，s accession had to be sacrificed to make the restoration an act mandated by Heaven.24
In 1587 there was no assurance that the present uncertainty would not lead to atrocities of the same dimensions. Civil officials, in both red and blue service robes, realized from past experience that at this point an unintentional gesture or speech, or even silence on their part, could many years later be seized upon by their enemies as evidence of treason or giving aid and comfort to a usurper, incriminating them and their families. Yet the danger also offered opportunities for the bold and daring to demonstrate their righteousness，with full knowledge that their audacity could very well lead them to future martyrdom and its attendant fatne. They delivered the most provocative memorials to the emperor and, when that was not enough, printed seditious pamphlets and circulated inflammatory handbills. The heavy moral content of the succession issue became firmly established only as a result of their efforts.
Toward the latter part of his reign, the Wan-li emperor must have been aware that because of his estrangement from his courtiers he would never escape history’s judgment of him as a ruler who had failed in his imperial responsibilities. But he did not even try to avoid this ultimate condemnation. His immediate concern was to keep the annoying criticisms out of his hearing. He made no attempt to exert his influence as an active ruler; yet as a passive one he refused to be dehumanized, or if he was, it had to be on his terms. His tragedy was that although he rejected his role as an instrument of the bureaucracy, the imperial constitution dictated that he could not function otherwise.
Part of Wan-li’s failure was that he was too intelligent and sensitive to occupy the dragon seat. The more he gained an insight into its apparatus the more skeptical he became. He began to realize that he was less the Ruler of All Men than a prisoner of the Forbidden City. His power was basically negative. He could remove or punish an official or a group of officials, but he could hardly promote a favorite or grant him an unusual honor. Above all, he could never employ a confidant who had public status. In response to the petitions of governors and ministers, he authorized exceptions to existing laws; but he could never revise a law directly from the throne. He was asked to arbitrate when the bureaucrats had a disagreement they could not resolve themselves; but he could not initiate more fundamental changes in order to avoid such an impasse. Moreover, in the case of Wan-li, his arbitration became progressively ineffective because as emperor he was recognized as neglecting his duties, and that recognition only encouraged the quarrelsome officials to counter his rulings with more protests and remonstrances. Every setback on the frontier was reported to His Majesty the Wan-li emperor; but he was restrained from issuing his own directives. Above all, he was not allowed to exercise personal command over the army. Unlike his ancestors, he was not free to leave the palace, let alone the capital. Was the benefit of occupying the imperial throne worth so many restrictions? He had no say in deciding that either. He had become the Son of Heaven by birth, not choice.25
The only way Wan-li could hope to exert some positive influence rested with his character, not his power. But to rely on his character meant reliving the days when he was manipulated by Chang Chii-cheng, remaining an abstract symbol of virtue and wisdom, and enduring all the ceremonial proceedings. The tedium of those proceedings was widely recognized. But few understood that to "Wen-li the suffering went beyond the discomfort of the sessions themselves. These practices made no distinction between the monarchy as an institution and the emperor as a person. When he performed the rituals he was subjecting himself to the rule of moral law， and moral law as the diehard bureaucrats interpreted it! Unlike his bureaucrats, he could never shield his yin with his yang. His moral obligation was virtually limitless.
The day Wan-li’s mother Tz’u-sheng died，the Ministiy of Rites promptly worked out the detailed procedures for observing national mourning for twenty-seven days. During the period all imperial subjects had to wear white headgear in public. Capital officials and army officers wore robes of unbleached hemp, the fringes unstitched. Instead of boots they wore straw sandals. Their black hats were covered with hemp fabric. The wings on their hats were detached, and in their place two white ribbons hung down to their shoulders. Meatless diet and abstention from alcoholic beverages were decreed in Peking for thirteen days，during which time the temples and chapels in the city rang their bells 30,000 times. Twice a day three days in a row，all officials，in addition to the wives of those of rank 4b and above， were ushered into the Forbidden City in groups. They stopped in front of the Palace of Compassionate Tranquility to perform the ceremonial wailing. The proceedings involved “fifteen laments and groans,” which were well coordinated. The sound had to be “suspended as soon as it was uttered.”28
Clearly enough, in this instance the empress dowager was being mourned less as a person than as a symbol of universal motherhood. The proceedings were basically disciplinary and theatrical. The compulsory lamentation reaffirmed the participants5 loyalty to the throne as well as underlining their subscription to filial piety. Conceivably，once the wailing was done, the mourners would be more than ever devoted to their own parents and would try harder to promote propriety and good feelings throughout the empire，so that His Majesty’s reign would go down in history as one of the most enlightened. But there was no indication that His Majesty himself was at this point convinced of such a result. He knew only too well that rituals led to more rituals. In the end the question would arise as to how much sincerity he，as sovereign，put behind the performances. The crucial point was whether he was leading a simple and frugal life or not. He had had enough of all this before and most definitely had no more appetite for it now. With the excuse that his Klower body was still infected by dampness and poison，” he called off the ceremony that would have required him to announce in public the honorary title of the deceased.27 Nevertheless, as the Jesuit fathers then residing in Peking reported, he spent a great deal of time seeing to it that his mother^ body was laid out comfortably in her coffin, taking care of all the details with his own hands.28
When Wan-li persistently refused to comply with the conventional requirements made of an emperor, his indolence became a legend—so much so that historians began to comment on his inborn laziness and to speculate on whether he had turned into an opium addict. None of these writers noted that of a sunny day Wan-li, having stayed away from ceremonial functions, often spent his time in the palace yard watching a game that he had organized for his eunuchs, where the players tossed silver pieces toward target areas marked on the ground, to have their bets doubled, tripled, or taken away by the dealer—a pastime that sadly reflected the state of the emperor’s active but unused mind, which could find no better outlet amidst the deep boredom of his life.29
Why did he not attempt to reorganize the empire, to make the office of emperor more substantial instead of symbolic and abstract? Many obstacles stood in his way. But above all there was the precedent of his granduncle, the Cheng-te emperor.
During the reign of Wan-li, the succession controversy brought another fundamental conflict into the open. Behind the scenes there was the fact that the monarchy had become such a highly stylized institution that no thinking man could occupy the dragon seat with comfort. Before the present emperor, the same conditions had been contested by Cheng-te. Although Wan-li was separated from his granduncle by about a half-century, what destiny had in store for him had been very much conditioned by the life and deeds of his predecessor.
Cheng-te had ascended the throne in 1505 when he was not yet fourteen. Endowed with unusual physical courage and a great deal of energy and creative curiosity, he soon discovered that those gifts only made him a gross misfit for the latter-day monarchy cast in the dynasty’s mold. Nevertheless， this unfortunate situation in no way deterred him from his own way of seeking happiness, which he pursued with all the authority at his command. To the chagrin of his courtiers, he also had the strength to defy and ignore their moral criticisms, and perhaps even to derive pleasure from doing so.30
A little over two years after his accession, Cheng-te moved out of his palace quarters. His new residence, designated the Leopard House, was constructed in the open space of the Imperial City, which consisted of clusters of apartments, hunting lodges, and club rooms.31 Soon he was surrounded by eunuchs, courtesans, Lamaist monks, and magicians from other lands. Court audiences and public study sessions were held by the fun-loving emperor only when it suited his convenience.32 His favorite pastimes were fishing and hunting. Once at least he was wounded by a tiger when he was learning to tame it，only to be rescued by his favorite army officer, Chiang Pin.
Chiang himself had attracted the emperor’s attention because of his daring. One of the three arrow wounds he had sustained in battle had left a scar on his face stretching into his ear. Ever since his interview with Cheng-te in 1512, he had been with the imperial entourage. The palace army was organized into two camps. Chiang Pin was in charge of a battalion of soldiers selected from the northern frontier units, while the emperor commanded his own battalion of mounted archers consisting of eunuchs. Yellow capes worn over armor and hats with sun visors decorated with feathers gave this legion a gallant appearance.33 Previously, Cheng-te had conducted field exercises with soldiers on the palace grounds.34 With Chiang Pin his military training acquired a professional touch. Now field maneuvers inside the Imperial City became a daily routine, followed by evening entertainments in the Leopard House. About civil affairs the monarch allowed his courtiers to fight with his eunuchs. Apparently he considered such quarrels inevitable and in any case not his specialty.35
The greatest thrill for Cheng-te came in 1517. Batu Mengke, the Mongol leader, had made incursions into the empire’s northern frontier several years in a row, inflicting heavy injuries. In October of that year, with 50,000 mounts, he again besieged a Ming general at a forward post. Leading the relief column, the emperor had the opportunity to test his own strategy as well as to see action.36 Later he claimed that during the engagement he had personally slain a Mongol.37
All this was not accomplished without bureaucratic opposition. First an imperial censor overseeing the defense on the Great Wall refused to let the emperor go beyond the barrier, as he had no business there. Forced to return to the capital, Cheng-te simply issued a formal order to remove that particular official and put a eunuch in his place. Only then was he able to enter the combat zone. For the next four months the civil officials virtually lost contact with the sovereign. The couriers run by the eunuchs between the capital and the emperor's forward headquarters delivered many petitions but few rescripts.
Most comical was the emperor’s triumphant return to Peking early the following year. The day before his arrival he ordered palace attendants to distribute to all officials silk fabrics of imperial design, with pythons and flying fish—up to this time reserved for rare honors—now to be handed out in large numbers. The badges of military and civil ranks were completely mixed up. The shape of the hats was designed by the emperor. That night the recipients of the textiles were told to have their costumes made in time for the welcoming assembly outside the city wall the next morning, which was to take place without a rehearsal. When the courtiers were further instructed to display banners and posters stating welcoming messages, they were in a dilemma as to how to find a proper way of addressing themselves; because His Majesty now chose to call himself £tGeneral of the Army of Greater Valor,n it would have been inappropriate for the officials to sign themselves “Your loyal subjects.” On the triumphal day it rained and snowed. The emperor, arriving on a chestnut-colored horse, stopped at the city gate for the ritual glass of wine handed him by the first grandsecretary, then galloped directly toward the Leopard House, leaving thousands of officials stumbling and slipping behind him in the muddy streets.38
As evidence of his victory the emperor displayed captured equipment before the palace.39 The imperial mint turned out silver medallions to commemorate the campaign, complete with colored ribbons.40 But Cheng-te’s jubilation was not shared by his court. The entire Han-lin Academy refused to congratulate him. A number of censorial-supervising officials took the opportunity to impeach themselves and ask to be relieved from duty.41 Even though the siege was broken by the relieving column and for the rest of Cheng-te^ reign Mengke never again became a serious threat, skeptical civil officials simply denied that the emperors campaign had been a success. According to them, only sixteen Mongols had been killed, at a disproportionate cost of six hundred Ming casualties.42
In the autumn of 1518, the emperor directed that a commission be granted to the General of the Army of Greater Valor for a visit to inspect the entire northern frontier. All four grand-secretaries refused to draft the
commission. One of them，prostrating himself on the ground in tears， begged the emperor to execute him rather than force him into such impropriety.43 Unmoved，Cheng-te proceeded to make the tour regardless. On the way he issued a personal order conferring on himself the title of Duke of Cheng-kuo in addition to that of General of the Army, at an annual stipend of 5,000 bushels of grain. Five months later he went on to proclaim himself (already a duke and generalissimo) Grand Preceptor, and thus the senior civil official of his own court, outranking all ministers and grand-secretaries.44
Cheng-te's second trip was uneventful; no enemy was encountered. But the emperor crossed the Yellow River and searched the edges of the Ordos before returning to Peking in the spring of 1519. During the nine months of his absence, remonstrating memorials submitted by capital officials first arrived by scores and then by the hundreds. In these papers the courtiers expressed their deep anxiety over the fact that the imperial capital had become an empty shell without the sovereign as its stabilizer. Two grand- secretaries argued that if the emperor demoted himself to a duke, by dynastic law the same title should be granted posthumously to his ancestors for three generations back. Would His Majesty be so unfilially pious as to demote his parents, grandparents, and great grandparents in addition to himself? The first grand-secretary was even more emphatic. He wanted to know who this person，the General of the Army of Greater Valor，was. He further suggested that whoever used that title in official documents be arrested and charged with falsifying the imperial order—a crime punishable by death.45
All these arguments fell on deaf ears. Cheng-te was too independent, too taken with his own nonconformity, and too confident of himself to be annoyed by such bookish disputations. He loved to drink and play games with his subordinates. He could not care less if a charming companion was a prostitute, was married, or even pregnant. During one of his tours of inspection he so mingled with his retinue that at the governor’s dinner party he was seated at the table without chopsticks! Many was the time he waved aside carriages and sedan chairs bearing the imperial insignia to ride in an unmarked wagon. At his grandmother's funeral service he saw that the ground was soaked with water, so he ordered that the customary kowtow by the court be omitted. His kindness was not appreciated. One of the officials thus deprived of the privilege of floundering in puddles of water to show his devotion to the imperial family wrote a strong protest to Cheng-te. A discourse on filial piety quoting Confucius and Mencius, this remonstrating memorial subsequently became a piece of ofl-cited literature, thus securing its author his place in history.46
How competent Cheng-te was as a general cannot be ascertained，as he excluded the literary-educational officials from his forward command post. But in the 1517 campaign he was definitely with the front-line troops. On his trip to the northwest during the winter of 1518—19, a snowstorm brought low all those around him. The emperor alone rode along in good spirits, carrying his own weapons. He never used his sedan chair.47 All these actions, however, became a prolonged nightmare to the civil officials. From their point of view, the ruler had abandoned his position as the Son of Heaven to take up a job that could have been relegated to any illiterate. Little did they realize that they were realty unhappy because the emperor was sabotaging their brand of statecraft, based upon the mandarin square, the kowtow, and the quoted verses from the Four Books.
Under the circumstances it was not surprising that in the spring of 1519, when Cheng-te made known his plan for a still more extensive tour in the southern provinces as generalissimo, all the censorial-supervising officials in the capital delivered two joint petitions against the trip. When those memorials were not rescripted, the petitioners knelt before the Meridian Gate to demand a prompt reply from the throne. Before the case was settled，officials from the literaiy-educational branch of government and the ministries delivered their circulating petitions. No matter how humble their words and sentences, they made it clear that they had e\gery right to demand satisfaction. The emperor's patience finally ran out. At the advice of Chiang Pin, who was now in charge of the capital garrison, Cheng-te retaliated by giving the order that the 146 demonstrators be beaten with whipping clubs for thirty strokes each. Eleven of them subsequently died of their injuries.48 The resignations of grand-secretaries, however, were po-litely rejected. The emperor knew that if he let them go he might never be able to find adequate replacements for them, as other bureaucrats would be bound to think that they too must avoid an office the moral obligation of which they had no hope of fulfilling.
Cheng-te delayed his tour until autumn. But he stayed in the south until the end of 1520. During one of his fishing trips his boat capsized. Though rescued from the water, he was said never to have fully recovered from the incident.49 Early the next year he died in the Leopard House without an heir. The grand-secretaries conferred secretly with the empress dowager to call in Wan-li’s grandfather and installed him as the next emperor. These events took place fifty-one years before Wan-li’s own accession.
On the surface Cheng-te had succeeded in frustrating, ridiculing, and defeating his bureaucrats with ease; they were always outmaneuvered by the sovereign. Under the circumstances one might be led to wonder, if imperial supremacy could be so easily asserted by one occupant of the throne, what prevented succeeding occupants from redefining the throned function to suit them? But the real story was far more complicated than this.
Rrst of all, while it would be difficult to say that the civil officials’ obedience was conditional, it could not be said that it was not without practical considerations. In fact, absolute monarchy of the dynasty's kind served a bureaucratic purpose. Repeatedly in the past matters brought by the civil officials to the throne for disposition had been thoroughly mingled with anomalies at every level. Imperial decisions on those matters became necessary, not because the word of the emperor was always just and rational, but because it was authoritative. This meant that the inviolability of the emperor had not been sought after as an end in itself. Together with the mystic quality of the throne，it was employed to sustain an administrative logic that the bureaucrats could not hope to maintain by themselves. It was essential that the sovereign, as the final arbiter of controversies, avoid personal entanglement in the issues. His character and personality must be hidden behind the image of the Son of Heaven. This requirement dictated that a latter-day emperor have virtually no chance to contribute his own creative energy to the functioning of his office.
By a stroke of genius Cheng-te evaded this process of dehumanization. He separated himself as an individual from the monarchy as an institution. But precisely because of this separation he failed in his assigned role and at the same time disrupted the standing practice of the bureaucracy.
The emperor's military operations, deviating from the contemporary in-stitutional arrangement, tended to reopen the issue of civil supremacy over the military, a supremacy that had existed for about one hundred years.50 His generalship notwithstanding, the ruler never stopped to think that his own realm could always provide a task-force strong enough to check Mengke's 50,000 cavaliymen if its commander-in-chief, like himself, were free to maneuver his battle formations and to draw services and supplies as he saw fit without being restrained by civil officials. In practice, however, this freedom of action was exactly what the empire wanted to deny its army commanders，who were restricted within their defense areas under the close supervision of frontier governors from the Civil Service and made accountable to them down to the last piece of equipment and the last man.
Without this stringent restriction, the 20,000 silk-robed officials could never have been able to deliberate on state affairs at their leisure, quoting Confucius and Mencius. Powerful generals not only had a tendency to emerge as domestic menaces, but also would have insisted on rapid practical solutions to problems, which would upset the doctrine of neutralizing opposites by means of undergoing ritualistic exercises and citing the Four Books.
What was the implication of the title General of the Army of Greater Valor? The emperor either intended to take over the operations of the entire military establishment or, at least, to set an example for his senior commanders. Whichever the case, the demand for dynamic responses to changing situations would have clashed with the sedentary nature of the Civil Service, which always operated by balancing compartmentalized responsibilities; this method had been consolidated by the dynasty^ taxation system and personnel management procedures. Besides, the bureaucrats also believed that striving too hard toward technical perfection was a hindrance to virtue; on the other hand, they also believed that no organizational incapacity could not be compensated by moral strength.
As loyal subjects, these civil officials never threatened the emperor. But when they knelt in the palace yard demanding a reply from the throne, it was nothing short of a confrontation. Even when abused, they refrained from rebellion. It would have been unrealistic，however, to expect them to rally behind the throne with the same degree of devotion in any future crisis, after the emperor had so repeatedly acted against their wishes and thwarted their purposes. During Cheng-te's reign two imperial princes, the emperor’s own cousins，raised standards to dethrone him, thinking that his alienation of the civil officials would lead to a transfer of the mandate of heaven. In fact they had miscalculated: their separate rebellions proved premature and were crushed. No one could predict, however, what might have happened if the Cheng-te emperor had lived longer and persisted in his concept of a free monarchy.
Cheng-te managed to reach his independent position for a number of reasons. He had no family ties. The influence the empress dowager had over him could be said to be less than marginal. None of the palace ladies did he hold in affection. And he died childless. At his accession all three grand-secretaries had been men of perfect virtue and great literary fame; but their pedantry made them helpless as far as court politics went.51 Given only two options—the boredom and self-discipline inherent in the abstract and passive government on the one hand, and hawks, hounds, and live soldiers on the other—the fun-loving youth simply followed his natural aptitude and chose the latter. Since they controlled the capital garrison and the Secret Police，his eunuchs and army officers were able to chastise the civil officials and eliminate them as an effective opposing force.
Yet in the long run the emperor’s rebellion against the established order produced only negative results. His temporaiy gain could not be institutionalized. He had no choice but to remain a playboy to the end of his career. Upon his death he was posthumously honored as the ^martial emperor,,5 a title not devoid of derogatory inferences. His adviser, Chiang Pin, still in command of the capital garrison，was lured into the palace，ar- rested, and later tortured to death. Charged with every conceivable crime, he was also said to have accumulated a personal fortune too enormous to be true.52
When Wan-li took over the reins of government after Chang Chii-cheng^ death in 1582, his colorful granduncle had passed from the scene more than sixty years before. But his story was by no means forgotten. The bureaucrats，who had previously been caught by surprise，now felt that they must benefit from the experience of the sequence of events recorded in the annals. Outwardly the despotism of the throne remained as potent as ever, yet it would be grossly mistaken to assume that the courtiers, as before, would not even bother to find out how this power, which so affected their lives and limbs, was invested. When they brought up the issue of the “foundation of the state，’，they meant to deal with an entire range of questions involving the designation of an imperial heir, his family life, parental guidance, classical education under the supervision of the Han-lin academicians, and the possible influence upon him of the eunuchs and army officers. They felt free to debate these questions，and sometimes even to scrutinize the current emperor in light of them.
Wan-li lacked the physical courage, exuberance, and aggressiveness of his granduncle. For a young man who had never for a single day experienced the feeling of freedom, or at any stage in his life earned what was his due, it was extremely difficult to set his own rules for conducting his office, which, in an era of uncertainty, would inevitably have had to undergo lengthy contention，regardless of who was occupying the throne. Besides， having studied the records of his granduncle, Wan-li knew that when they stood together the civil officials could be a formidable body. Thus irreso- lute，the unadvised emperor again and again yielded to his courtiers. But he was neither gracious enough to forgive nor magnanimous enough to forget. His pride was hurt; his sensitivity drove him to seek revenge, not so much to recover the authority of the throne as to vent his anger. The actions he took were therefore often remote from the area of previous conflict, sometimes causing injury to those who had not had the slightest intention of offending him. Yet his most effective weapon remained inaction.
That is why, as the idle sovereign watched his eunuchs tossing silver pieces in the palace yard, his empire was sliding into an abyss. No matter how the succession issue was to be settled, the Civil Service had already lost its balance and would remain a turbulent body. That being the case, what difference did it really make if His Majesty the Wan-li emperor had become an opium addict,53 or was inherently lazy, or was growing tired of being a passive and cloistered sovereign?
But to a handful of people who knew the emperor well, including former First Grand-Secretary Shen Shih-hsing, it did make a difference.54 Given another set of environmental conditions, Wan-li could have acted differently. Since childhood he had been observed to be precocious. He was responsive. Tz'u-sheng's close supervision had given him a sense of purpose. At one time he was veiy much distressed by official corruption; he was sufficiently concerned about the problem to draft a decree personally forbidding the exchange of valuable gifts among governmental functionaries. He had once taken ceremonial rituals seriously. He had asked why so many officials absented themselves from his morning audience; and he had shown displeasure when the officials did not drill themselves to perform their part in ceremonies with flawless perfection.55 In later years, when his critics grumbled about his permanent suspension of the public study sessions, few remembered that at one time the Wan-li emperor had insisted that his grand-secretaries supply him with the Veritable Records of all the reigns preceding his own, and had taken the initiative in discussing the content of the historical lessons.56 Similarly, once his indolence became well known, it was difficult to recall that at one time his courtiers had been afraid he might be carried away by his enthusiasm, for instance, on the occasion when he conducted an archery contest on a hot summer day that lasted until evening and caused several eunuchs to faint from the intense heat.57
No one could say for sure exactly when and how the turning point was reached. But considering first the emergence of the succession issue and then a sequence of events that truly disturbed the Wan-li emperor, 1587 or thereabouts should not be overlooked as a line of demarcation. So the Year of the Pig, though seemingly insignificant, may, over the long course of history, have some significance after all.
