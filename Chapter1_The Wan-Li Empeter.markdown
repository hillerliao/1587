The action taken by the throne was nevertheless considered to be just and final. 

The Wan-li emperor, now turning twenty-four, was himeself a veteran of ceremonial proceedings. By March 1587 he had been the Son of Heaven for almost fifteen years. Even before his enthronement, when not yet nine years old, he had gone through the ritual of capping, which prematurely ushered in his manhood. Thereafter he was no longer considered a child, at least not in public.

万历皇帝是熟悉各种礼仪的君主。1587年3月，他已年满二十三，进入二十四，登上皇帝的宝座也快有十五年了。他自然会清楚记得，在他八岁那一年的冬天，他的父亲隆庆皇帝为他举行了象征成为成人的冠礼。

Wan-li still remembered that winter day when he was led into a screened cubicle temporarily erected in the courtyard, from which he emerged three times, always clad in a new set of garments. Each time he was crowned with a different hat. The assortment of headgear and robes was the geralia designated for various ceremorial functions into which he, as heir apparent, must be initiated. Between the changes in the wardrobe, he was instructed to kneel down, stand up, turn around, hold a scepter, and drink wine from a specila cup -- all to the accompaniment of music and the chanting of ceremonial officials. The proceedings took the whole morning. The next day the boy sat stiffly to receive the formal congratulations of the court officilas. 

他被引导进入殿前特设的帷帐里，按照礼仪的规定更换衣冠服饰，前后三次都以不同的装束出现于大庭广众之中。既出帷帐，他就手持玉圭，被引导行礼，并用特设的酒杯饮酒。全部节目都有礼官的唱导和音乐伴奏，所需的时间接近半天。第二天，他又被引导出来坐在殿前，以最庄重的姿态接受了百官的庆贺[3]。
