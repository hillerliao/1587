For Shen Shih-hsing the moral burden was heavy every time he drew close to the Literary Floral Hall, a yellow-tiled building on the eastern side of the palace compound where the emperor held his private and public study sessions. It was there that one day in 1574 he had watched the Wan-Ii emperor, then ten years old, execute a sheet of calligraphy, Present Me to Goodness and Purify Me.1. The scroll was a message for Shen. He had been touched to receive a unique personal gift from the throne so preco­ciously and appropriately composed. Thirteen years later, Tutor Shen still had the imperial handwriting hanging in his residence; but now, alas, the early promise of a brilliant reign by Wan-li might never come to fruition.

Although Shen Shih-hsing was not one of the five instructors who had taught the crown his basic subjects, he had lectured before the emperor longer and more often than anyone else.4 Now, as first grand-secretary, he also had overall responsibility for the latter's study sessions, which is why the reigning monarch addressed him as "My Dear Tutor."11 Seldom did a whole month slip by without his receiving something from the throne as a reward for his service. These imperial gifts were sometimes tokens in the form of two samli, baskets of arbutus, folding fansf and branches of mugwort—articles of seasonal significance merely to remind the instructor that he was not forgotten on special occasions. But sometimes they could be quite substantial，consisting, for example, of pieces of silver and rolls of silk fabric in palace designs.3

Whether or not the gifts from the throne had financial value, it was the courtesy of the emperor that counted, with its implication of the recipient’s prestige and influence. Indeed, in these days to be appointed an emperor's instructor was a crucial turning point in a bureaucrat's career. Not everyone so appointed was destined to reach the highest office; but few of those who had not received the appointment could even hope to arrive at the top. To be a lecturer at the public sessions attended by the emperor himself especially attested a court official's unchallengeable erudition. He must be a highly qualified theoretician of statecraft if not a simultaneous practitioner of it.

By tradition the emperor's private study sessions started as soon as he was designated imperial heir, or when he reached six years old; at that time he was introduced to the Han-lin academicians. His public study sessions followed the enthronement and lasted throughout his reign. Held in the spring and autumn when the weather was comfortable, the public sessions took place three times a month. Attendance by all six ministers, two chief censors, all grand-secretaries, and other dignitaries, including the top aristocratic title-holders nominally on duty with the imperial army, was mandatory. The crowd was augmented by six supervising secretaries and cere­monial officials, all in their embroidered robes.

The session started very early in the morning, right after sunrise. To stress the solemnity of the occasion, the emperor arrived with twenty body- guards. Although not in armor as during other rituals, they carried their ceremonial weapons. First the sovereign took his seat in the study hall facing the doomay on the souths. At his command the assembly of officials entered the Literary Floral Gate. In the yard at the top of the granite staircase they kowtowed to the emperor. Only then were two lecterns car­ried in by the ceremonial officials and placed before the emperor, one just in front of him and the other facing it two steps away, for the lecturers. By this time the participating officials had filed into the buildings. According to rank and function, they flanked the path extending from the imperial seat to the doorway, including the lecterns.

Like all ceremonies, this one achieved audio and visual symmetry and balance. Each session was to begin with the exposition of selected verses from the Four Books, to be followed by a lecture based on another classical work, often historical. Two identical sets of textbooks, together with lecture notes neatly copied and submitted one day in advance for His Majesty's preview, had been placed on the lecterns. A volume of the Four Bookes was always on the sovereign's lefthand side. At the chanting of the master of ceremonies, two lecturers in red robes and two librarian assistants in dark blue, all Han-Iin academicians, broke from the ranks of lined-up officials to take their positions, the lecturers with backs to the doorway facing the emperor, the librarian assistants on two sides facing each other. Now the lecturers performed their own round of kowtowing. That done, the li­brarian assistant on the left came close to His Majesty's lectern and knelt. He turned to the exact page of the copy of Four Books and spread out his lecture notes. Simultaneously the lecturer on the left advanced one-and-a- half steps to the center and started his discussion. When he had finished, the copy of he Four Books was duly closed. The I wo performers retreated in good order to make way for their counterparts on the right. the entire proceedings occupied a good portion of the morning, through which the emperor, the only one seated, remained motionless and at attention. If he should inadvertently cross his legs, the lecturer was obligated to quote classical sources asking the question: Can the ruler himself neglect the principle of propriety? The question was repeated until it elicited a silent answer. The sovereign, awed by the reprimand, would revert to his original posture.

With all its ritualistic trappings, the lecture was a vital state institution. Though elucidating classical works, the lecturers were expected to relate their messages to the current affairs of the state. Not only were the dietums about the primary duties of the Son of Heaven, including his concern for the well-being of the people and the absolute importance of maintaining general moral standards, immediately applicable to the entire audience—not least the seated sovereign; but citing historical events was a way of compar­ing past with present, and thus of reiterating the close relationship between ethics and public well-being. A good lecturer must achieve this purpose. Imperial tutors who merely presented perfunctory lectures or used them to flatter the throne were considered disloyal and in some cases in the past had been dismissed.

When criticizing the emperor, the lecturer had, of course, to choose sub­tle approaches to make his inferences least offensive. The sovereign was entitled to ask questions and even to add comments of his own. But to challenge the speaker during the course of the lecture would have been a serious breach of decorum. Even if the instructor should go wrong because of poor preparation, imperial displeasure must be held back for the time being，to be expressed later at some opportune moment，and indirectly. This immunity of the lecturer had been observed even by Cheng-te, the present emperor's granduncle, who had broken many traditions but never this rule. Though he loathed the remarks on his personal conduct re­peatedly implied in the lectures, he nevertheless managed to maintain his forbearance. His only retaliatory measure took the form of sudden promo­tions of his most critical instructors to the remotest posts of the empire.

Now no longer a performer at the study sessions, Shen Shih-hsing was their planner and coordinator. His office of the Grand-Secretariat at the Literary Depth Pavilion was also located inside the Meridian Gate. How­ever, many interior gates and partitions separated it from the throne hall and the emperor's living quarters. On many working day the sovereign and his chief counsellor might not be more than a thousand yards away from each other, but it was the the longest thousand yards in the world. Aside frorm the morning audience and the study sessions, the emperor rarely saw his grand-Secretaries. Their intercommunications were conducted on paper, althoutgh sometimes imperial orders were relayed verbally by eunuchs. Very seldom did Wan-li summon a grand-secretary for consultation. When Shen Shih-hsing held the position, he was summoned on the average less than once a year. And the last time an emperor had visited the office of the Grand-Secretariat was 160 years earlier.

The Literary Depth Pavilion consisted of a main hall housing a statue of Confucius. It had four offices in addition to library facilities on the sides and in the attic. A bungalow across the yard provided working space for clerical assistants. As the nerve center of a large empire the layout was notably unassuming. But it had already been greatly improved from what it used to be during the earlier days of the dynasty when, in fact a "pavilion,"  it had served as little more than a place for the emperor's document officers to sit. The extension of office space, additional furnishings, and employment of clerical personnel marked the maturity of the secretariat. Only now it was not so clear whether the pavilion was a liaison office between the Civil Service and the throne, a command post over the ministries, merely an advisory body, or even an arbitrating agency. A great deal of its work could be described as the application of abstract principles to real problems. Often when, with the emperor's approval, it made a deci­sion about personnel management or something else, the published justification for the move possessed moral overtones which blurred the practical issues behind it. This departure from the true points at issue resulted from a lack of statutory guidance thal could deal with the legal technicalities of specific details. But the practice made public discussion of classical works even more vital, as they supported these moral overtones.7

Shen Shih-hsing had no reason to enjoy these public lessons any more than anyone else did. The sessions were much too long, the proceedings too formal. The themes chosen from classical sources had never been astoundingly interesting. To be on time for the assembly, he had to get up well before daybreak. Like all the other participants, before the middle of the session he felt tired and would be looking forward to the food and wine to be served in the reception room at the Left Concord Gate immediately afterward. But even this treat had to wait until the lecterns were removed, all the participants had filed in good order from the lecture hall，and had kowtowed once more to the emperor in the yard outside the building. At the gate room the banquet had been prepared in advance; yet it took a long time to seat everyone. The ranks and positions of the participants must be observed; nevertheless, exceptions were made for the lecturers, librarian assistants, and copyists who had duplicated the lecture notes, who took seats of higher honor over those of the same grade as themselves.

As the first grand-secretary, Shen Shih-hsing was personally responsible for maintaining the session in perfect order. He would feel disturbed if the Wan-li emperor showed signs of fatigue during the proceedings, a lecturer did not perform as well as expected, or something else went wrong with the ritual. By 1587, the Year of the Pig, he must have attended such lectures more than a hundred times, as prior to Wan-li's reign he had lectured in front of the Lung-ch'ing emperor. On the granite apron outside the Literary Floral Hall he had prostrated himself so often that he practically recognized its every stone. Not to mention the long hours of standing inside!

Sometimes Shen wondered why he had to be the one to argue that the study sessions must continue. Would not he，for his own sake，also love to be excused from the agonizing routine? The same thing applied to the emperors morning audience. Even Censor-in-Chief Keng Ting-hsiang, a vigorous man, confessed in one of his essays that he nad great difficulty during the predown event. It was worse on cold winter days. Like Keng, Shen Shih-hsing had originally come from the south where the weather was never like that of Peking. When，the previous winter, on a bitterly cold morning, he had overheard his colleagues saying that one man's white face had turned red and another's red face had turned black, he knew that his own admonition to carry on the audience proceedings would never make him popular.8

In 1587 Shen Shih-hsing was fifty-two years old. As he had pointed out in one of his memorials to the emperor, his hair and beard had already started to turn gray when he was still in his forties. As first grand-secretary, wearing a robe of the python design, he had also reached the highest rank of the Civil Service ladder.10 And then, there was the prior example of Chang Chii-cheng. Why not relax and take things as they come?

Relax indeed he could; he was never known as an impetuous man. But take things as they come he must not. In providing the best leadership to an empire such as ours, there was no substitute for ritualistic proceedings. The emperor did not have a formidable army at his command; he did not even have a large land base. He remained the Son of Heaven only because every­body believed that he was. This belief required the ritualistic exercises involving the sovereign and his chief ministers to be enacted with vigor and  regularity, completely in a public spirit, and accompanied by aesthetic and moral overtones. Pageantry or not, the many rounds ot kowtow reaffirmed  imperial supremacy; yet merely the fad that the emperor at­tended the ceremonies indicated that he was subjecting himself to the cosmic order and moral law. It was precisely because the messages taken  from  the basic classical sources were dull and trite that one must be pre­pared to listen to them again and again. The heat and cold and the predawn hour only tested the human will. This idea of discipline and endurance had been emphasized by Censor Keng. Even in the emperor's farming ritual obviously a degree of make-believe was involved; but make-believe is not necessarily unreal. One must realise how powerful an instrument of government it was when all the participants shared a belief in it. The emperor’s public study sessions symbolized an even more concrete meaning: the occupant of the throne and his best policymakers were seeking classical and historical guidance to arrive at an enlightened administration.

Thinking this way did not help Shen Shih-hsing to feel any easier, be­cause in 1587 there was little evidence that his tutorship over the emperor was a success. If it was, why had the twenty-four-year-old Wan-li emperor twice within the past twelve months declared that he had suffered from blackout when rising early in the morning and therefore had to have his audience with the court and the study sessions suspended for unspecified periods of time? Why had this happened both times in early autumn, when a new series of lectures had just gotten under way? More disturbing still was the fact that, though Wan-li had said he was unwell, the eunuchs revealed that His Majesty had been horseback-riding at the palace stable. He might even have been thrown from a horse and injured his forehead, which he did not want the courtiers to see.12 News of the incident had circulated widely, causing a secretary from the Ministy of Rites to remonstrate against the emperor for his negligence of duty and failure to take care of himself as the Son of Heaven. This fuss had hardly died down when in the early spring Wan-li again asked to be excused from public functions, this saying that，owing to an overabundance of the fire element in his body, he had taken some cooling medicine which, however, had driven the burning discomfort down to his feet，causing such unbearable itching that his resultant scratching had torn his skin. In the meantime stories persis­tently leaked out that the monarch was drinking to excess, was staying out loo late at night, and was overly involved with the palace ladies.13

There was little that Tutor Shen could do. With care he spread the stationery on his desk to compose a most persuasive memorial pleading with His Majesty, for the sake of the Imperial Shrine to take good care of himself. In it he nevertheless pointed out that the founder of the dynasty, the Hung-wu emperor, had carried on his public study sessions to the very end of his reign, by which time he was close to seventy. Would this message sway the young sovereign? The first grand-secretary was not sure.

In an anxious and gloomy moment, Shen Shih-hsing once wrote diagnosing the ailment of the empire as “a cleavage betweern the top and the bottom," which, he went on to explain, meant “the separation of the interior from the exterior.” “Never since ancient times,” he continued, “has a state under these conditions managed to remain in peace and order for long.”15

But Shen Shih-hsing did not like to give up easily. At times he confided to his close friends that he found himself in an impossible position. He also wrote poems blaming himself for his own failure and expressing his wish to retire so that he might enjoy the leisure of a gentleman-farmer in his native Soochow.16 Once such feelings had been vented, however, he turned his attention back to his office. If the emperor said that his trouble was itching feet, then the first grand-secretary had to believe him. He should be grateful that the sovereign disclosed his discomfort at such length. This in itself was a good sign and his absence could not be more than a temporary setback, as even according to the emperor's own descriplion his was not a serious illness. Having appointed the new librarian assistants, Tutor Shen was ready to resume the lectures any time the emperor was. But while he waited he also pondered the possibility of whether Wan-Ii could be persuaded to continue his studies at some later time of day, such as midmorning, if getting up early was too much for him.

The first grand-secretary was an effective persuader. As such, he must be prepared to be a believer. Unless he convinced himself that certain methods would work, it would be deceitful and pointless to solicit the commitment of others to them. In a situation where things needed to be done,he could not wait for others to make the initial move before he joined them. He must be willing to rake the plunge without reservation. This prior commitment, called by him ''sincerity' would then enable him to inspire others and be ready to accept only partial commitment on their part. In a letter to his friend, he disclosed that he was mustering his maximum sincerity to win the heart of the emperor.

In reality a state of mental assertion, or the mobilization of will power in a group effort, this quality of sincerity was cited in the opening paragraphs of the Four Books. It was to put this citation and other doctrines from the classics to work that the services of academicians like Shen Shih-hsing had been enlisted.

In 1587 Shen Shih-hsing had been the first grand-secrecary for four years. He had attained that position because of what seemed to be a capricious sequence of events.

When Chang Chii-cheng died in 1582, his position had passed to Chang Ssu-wei. But in less than a year the second Chang's father also died. It would have been absolutely impossible for him to maneuver to remain in office. In his absence, Shen Shih-hsing, not too long ago the junior grand-secretary, was ordered to act on Chang’s behalf, as very shortly before then death and illness had eliminated all those senior to him. Most unexpect	edly, Chang Ssu-wei was never to return.  His mourning completed, he himself fell ill and never recovered.

In 1587, Shen Shih-hsing was in the prime of life despite his constant references to his gray hair. Since his parents had been buried for a number of years, his career was never to be interrupted by mourning. But neither was he as ambitious as his predecessors; in fact, to be mild and gentle was his ambition. His biographers went to great lengths to describe him as reserved and unpresumptuous, and as “a man who refused to stand on precipitous cliffs.” It was destiny that made him first the emperor’s chief counsellor and then the center of a controversy which eventually forced him to turn in his resignation no fewer than eleven times before he was permit­ted to leave his high post.

True, being labeled as Chang Chii-cheng's Protégé was a handicap. Yet immediately after 1582 who in the high echelons of government was not? It might even be said that Shen Shih-hsing had earned Chang Chii-cheng's trust more by merit and less by maneuver than had Chang Ssu-wei; and once Chang Chii-cheng was dead and thus unable to fend off the variety of charges against him, Shen Shih-hsing recognized Chang's mistakes but refused to make the deeds of his former mentor appear worse than they were. These sterling qualities were recognized by his fellow officials, and undoubtedly also by the Wan-li emperor.

Like most grand-secretaries, Shen Shih-hsing had started his official career within the literary-educational branch of the government. Ever since he had distinguished himself in 1562 by winning first place among 299 successful candidates at the palace examinations, he had been assigned to the Han-lin Academy.21 He served there for fifteen years, first as a literary editor and finally as a reader-in-waiting. Before his appointment to grand-secretary in 1578 the only nonacademic position he had ever held was that of vice-minister for seven months. Like his predecessors Chang Chu-cheng and Kao Kung, he never held office outside the capital.

Did top academicians automatically become superb statesmen? How would court historians and great prose-writers qualify as the emperor’s personal advisers? Where and how would they gain administrative experience? Twenty-five years earlier Han-lin bachelor Shen Shih-hsing could have asked the same questions. But now Grand-Secretary Shen Shih-hsing no longer had any doubt about these issues. Why? Because our empire was created to be controlled from the center by documents; field experience or the lack of it made very little difference.

There were 1,100 counties within the realm, of which each magistrate was appointed by His Majesty the Emperor. Could any one sitting in the capital really control how these magistrates managed their districts? Of course not. The best he could do was to investigate their characters, and through personal evaluation at periodic intervals divide the magistrates into categories and earmark them for promotion and demotion. Only occa­sionally, at best, were outstanding accomplishments promptly cited along with those who had achieved them, and the worst cases of mismanagement and negligence immediately dealt with. This meant that the greater part of governmental business involved personnel management and was basically settled on paper according to general standards.

Moreover, even though some magistrates could fully utilize their talents and work conscientiously, their enlightened administration was by no means efficient government in any ordinal sense. For instance, people in a district might speak a dialect the magistrate did not understand; the local population might even have customs that made no sense to him. Even in a populous county, he never had more than six assistants, who, like himself, held Civil Service ranks. The rest of the office help consisted of perhaps a dozen locally recruited clerks. Serving a threc-year term as magistrate, the individual official was simply not commissioned to innovate and to carry out specific policies. Often he found the best he could hope for was that the district would remain in reasonably good order and its tax quota be fulfilled. In discharging these responsibilities he actually implemented a kind of indirect rule: he must invite and inspire the support of the local gentry. This group of retired officials—students of imperial universities, nominated scholars, and some purchasers of rank—being men of sub­stance in rural communities, could be induced to make their influence prevail over the populace until taxes were paid on time, disputes settled behind the scenes rather than flaring up in lawsuits, the poor taken care of by their clans, widows never remarried, and the filially pious commanded respect in the district and were imitated. OnThe empire was not set up to wage wars, to reconstruct its own society, to conduct a national program of any kind, nor even to improve the stan­dard of living of the populace aside from taking preventive measures against famine. Its purpose was to maintain peace and stability. How could this desired peace and stability be preserved? One certainly could not work directly with the peasants: they were the governed, not the governing. In any case, illiteracy excluded them from any meaningful dialogue. There was also a limit to which a grand-secretary  could go by approaching the gentry. For Shen Shih-hsing, anything he wished to accomplish could only be accomplished with the bureaucrats.

In 1587, the Year of the Pig, 3000 peasants in Shantung had taken up banditry. The left censor-in-chief reported that the White Lotus Sect, taking advantage of the poor harvest of the previous years, was enlarging its membership. The situation was alarming. But being alarmed was of little help; nor could the problem be solved by dealing with these 3,000 bandits alone. The basic solution had to rest with the ability of the entire bureaucracy to work together as a team, in harmony and mutual trust. Failing that, there was no way to direct the 1,100 county magistrates and tell them how to manage their districts, parental officials though they were supposed to be. Yet before the bureaucrats could work together with mutual confidence and a common purpose, their morale had to be improved.

Politics and government, as the first grand-secretary saw it, was no more than culture. As such it was part of daily life and subject to the rule of common sense. if the bureaucrats in the capital did not even see the emperor for months, it would be difficult for them to believe that he still had everything under his firm control.  Next they would question whether he really cared about their problems. In the end they would seriously doubt that their work was even appreciated. Suspecting  this, they would be unlikely to attend to their offices with dedication and devotion. This meant that sincerity would soon be lost. The empire would have ”a cleavage between the top and the bottom,” and there would be “a separation of the interior from the exterior,” as Shen Shil-hsing had warned. When these conditions prevailed, banditry would increase; and in the future more poor harvests would drive more hunger-stricken peasants to join the various popular religious sects. which would in turn, start more uprisings.

In order to work with thousands of governmental officials, Shen Shih-hsing simply had to pledge his own sincerity. He might be called a great compromiser. But it was clear that unless he acted the way the official wanted, they might not function the way he wanted. This was tantamount to saying that while the bureaucracy was created to carry out governmental functions, the most pressing problem it had to handle was none other than the bureaucracy itself — a simple and fundamental fact which, ironically enough, with all his maneuvers and brilliance Chang Chii-cheng had overlooked.ly under these conditions would the district earn its reputation of being  ”pure and honest,” and its magistrate make his own name as a good ‘parental official,’ not one who was  ”frivolous and unstable.” Yet all these objectives involved the human touch, no strange organizational principle. 23

As a Han-lin academician Shen Shih-hsing knew the human approach only too well. He had drafted letters of commendation for the emperor to award to chaste widows and men of age and virtue. He had lectured before the Wan-li emperor that a ruler should see to it that in good years the population had enough to eat and in bad years at least not die of starvation, and that the kingly way of ancient times, still applicable to the present day, was no more than to promote faith and harmony and elect good men to office. When their goals were accomplished, the state was already acting in the cosmic spirit, even though it might continue to follow the established ritualistic proceedings to ensure auspiciousness.

Of course sometimes technical decisions had to be made. At a specific time and in a specific place, a tribal chieftain on the frontier might better be pacified rather than pressed militarily. There could be advantages—or fewer disadvantages—if in certain areas the Yellow River could be slightly diverted to the south rather than following its present channel. The ratio between horses and tea traded on the frontier might need readjusting. But again, decisions such as these could be made by governors-general and imperial commissioners on the scene rather than by the emperor and his grand-secretaries in the capital. Although by tradition these issues must be referred to the throne for approval, such approval could be a matter of routine if capable men had been assigned the task. Once more this meant that the essence of the business in the imperial court was the management of personnel. Indeed, the structure demanded grand-secretaries to equip themselves with at least a working knowledge of geography and history, which only enhanced the qualifications of the former members of the Han-lin Academy. They had, after all, spent years familiarizing themselves with these subjects. In fact, the best geographical and historical works about our empire were compiled by the Han-lin academicians.

Before becoming grand-secretary in 1578, Shen Shih-hsing had partici­pated in and supervised the preparation of the Veritable Records of the two reigns preceding the present emperor's and the Collected Institutes covering the entire span of the dynasty. This assjgnment required him to read all state papers chronologically arranged for decades. It would have been difficult to find a better way to prepare himself to be the emperor’s counsellor.24

Shen was now regarded by his colleagues as an elder statesman. This had little to do with his chronological age, which actually put him at eight years younger than Second Grand-Secretary Hsii Kuo and one year younger than Third Grand-Secretary Wang Hsi-chiieh. Shen Shih-hsing was nevertheless recognised to be “mellow” and “stable,” having derived his seasoned expeerience from long study and reflection. This accumulated wisdom en­abled him to think that when a proposal was useful to our empire, usuallyit was not because the idea was original or logically convincing, but be­cause it suited our constitution. In order to be acceptable, it must agree with the general practice of the Civil Service. A line of action would be of little use unless it fulfilled the long-term interests of the empire. Localized schemes promising short profit, even if ingeniously conceived, often pro­duced illusory and even adverse effects.

The empire was not set up to wage wars, to reconstruct its own society, to conduct a national program of any kind, nor even to improve the stan­dard of living of the populace aside from taking preventive measures against famine. Its purpose was to maintain peace and stability. How could this desired peace and stability be preserved?

In order to work with thousands of governmental officials, Shen Shih-hsing simply had to pledge his own sincerity. He might be called a great compromiser. But it was clear that unless he acted the way the official wanted, they might not function the way he wanted. This was tantamount to saying that while the bureaucracy was created to carry out governmental functions, the most pressing problem it had to handle was none other than the bureaucracy itself — a simple and fundamental fact which, ironically enough, with all his maneuvers and brilliance Chang Chii-cheng had overlooked.

By defenition the bureaucracy included both army officers and civil officials. But in practice the military bureaucracy had never been politically important; the officers corps was not even politically conscious. With the exception of the period under the first two founding emperors, during the Ming dynasty civil dominance over the military was complete. An army general was purely a technician. His prestige having sunk to the lowest level in history, he might have his moment of glory in attending a special court ceremony. But in ordinary times he was regarded by the civil officials with disdain and excluded from decision-making.

At the time when Shen Shih-hsing was first grand-secretary, the Civil Service, the only element to be reckoned with, had about 20,000 members.” About one-tenth of them held offices in the capital. It was always a spectacular scene when they assembled in their service robes, rank 4b and above in red and rank 5a and below in blue. They all wore black lacquer-treated hats with wings protruding sideways. Their black boots had very thick soles, the sides of which were trimmed with white lacquer. Their ceremonial belts, more like loops dangling loosely from their waists but never drawn tightly were backed with jade, rhinoceros horn, and gold and silver pieces that added splendor to the sight of the assembly as they glittered in the sun, showing the grades of the wearers’ ranks.

The badge of rank itself was called the “mandarin square,” a chief-piece embroidered with elegant birds, always in pairs. The top rank (1) was represented by two stately cranes soaring above clouds, the lowest rank (9) by a couple of earthbound quail pecking the grass. During cercain state ceremonies,army officers were authorized to wear the same service robes, except that their breast-patches carried images of fierce animals—lions and tigers, bears and panthers, and so on. The censorial-supervising branch of the government had its own badge of identification. As civil officials, its members, regardless of rank, all wore embroidered breast-patches showing a legendary animal called hsieh-chih, which according to tradition could distinguish good from evil. Completely harmless to men of virtue, the shieh-chih could allegedly smell an immoral character from a distance and would instantly leap at him and tear him to pieces. Another exception to the general rule was that a handful of civil officials, army officers, and chief eunuchs wore robes with designs of pythons and flying fish. Only authorized personally by the emperor, these badges of honor elevated the wearer above all service ranks. Shen Shih-hsing had received his Order of the Python two years before, in 1585.

With very few exceptions, members of the Civil Service had quaiified for it through the competitive examinations held once every three years. Those who passed the examination at the provincial level were awarded licentiate degrees, which made them eligible for appointment at the lowest rank, 9b, unless they preferred to take the higher examination at the capital or to enter imperial universities for further study. Those who passed the upper level of examinations were awarded doctoral degrees and were usually eligible for grade 7b. Counting the screening tests and qualifying examinations at the county level which the candidates had to pass before they were even admitted to the contest, the system, when in operation, must have involved close to one million aspirants to official positions, and included virtually all of the empire's literary talent.

An important aspect of the examination system was that, aside from the Civil Service, avenues for individuals to gain prominence and demonstrate their creative energies were extremely limited, in many cases nonexistent. It was not unusual for the success of a candidate to depend upon the concerted effort of his whole family. Although when success came he could go from rags to riches in his lifetime，his way to good fortune had as a rule been paved by his parents or even his grandparents, whose foresight and single-mindness had enabled him to attain the necessary education. The self-sacrifice of widowed mothers and devoted wives remained a common theme behind such success stories, as attested by numerous emotion-packed tombstone inscriptions written by worthy sons and sad but grateful husbands in tribute to them. 

Aware of such concerted efforts, many counties routinely erected stone arches in front of the houses of native sons, who had just received their licentiate degrees. Imperial conferring of honors on meritorious officials usually included their ancestors for three generations back and their wives. It often happened that most of them were no longer alive. Their honorary ranks and titles of Imperial Lady were nevertheless engraved on new tombstones and erected to replace the old. Artists were commissioned to paint their portraits reconstructed from memory and oral instructions, complete with silk robes and mandarin squares, which they were unlikely ever to have caught sight of in their own lifetimes.

Special orders of commendation issued by the emperor to honor the deceased were very much prized, because these letters could be passed on to posterity. Not only did they redound to the credit of the ancestors cited, but to that of the descendants of those who had earned the citations as well. Sometimes a ranking official petitioned the throne to have his own promotion deferred in exchange for such a patent of honor,9 Shen Shih-hsing could not have forgotten all these details. As a Han-lin academician he must have composed dozens of such imperial eulogies for the throne. Recently he had also handled a petition by the second grand-secretary, Hsii Kuo, who wished to defer his promotion in order to honor the memory of his parents and wife, all dead for many years.

With so much in common, the corps of civil officials had to be a coherent body, especially the capital officials, who were the cream of the crop. All of them had learned from childhood to recite the text of the Four Books, along with the officially approved commentaries by Chu Hsi. Therefore they were thoroughly familiar with the doctrine that the essence of government is compassion, by which it was meant that a cultured gentleman, aware of his own concern over the necessities of life and his preoccupation with his own family, could not help but extend this concern and preoccupation to serve others, who also had their needs to fulfil and their loved ones to take care of. Moreover, being educated, these civil bureaucrats were all bound by propriety. They knew, for instance, that one must care about and respect one's sister-in-law at a distance. Yet for every sacred rule there were exceptions: if one's sister-in-law happened to be drowning one would naturally bo expected to put aside daily decorum long enough to jump in the water and save her if one could. In this respect morals were no more than com­mon sense. A world of order would be in sight if every individual followed his native instinct to do good.

Besides being enlightened, officials could also be jovial; on occasion they had the pleasure of mimicking the several masters of ceremony. They would demonstrate how one knew only how to mew and another only how to wail.  Although solemn at ritualistic proceedings, they often had a good laugh afterward at having seen a minister of some state ceremonial miss a turn himself, or more shocking still, a dignified general in his service robe suddenly kneel to the emperor before the chanting had called for it, which could throw the entire assembly into a state of confusion.

Yet were these capital officials, all 2,000 of them, really and at all times good-natured and congenial with one another, full of humor and compassion, and acting as a team in accordance with propriety and good common sense? Had this been the case, they could have transformed the outlook of the provincial and local officials, who in turn would have improved the administration in their districts until all had been declared pure and hon­est. Certainly had such ideal conditions existed, the severe penal code that prescribed death by torture for so many offenses could have been elimi­nated, continual evaluation of personnel within the bureaucracy would not have been required, and there would never have been the need to dress up so many civil officials as hsieh-chih monsters in order to police the bureaucracy itself. As for Shen Shih-hsing, if such official harmony had become a reality, his life would have been much simpler and far more pleasant, and the scandal of Chang Chii-cheng might never have occurred.

Shen Shih-hsing's subscription to sincerity, however, did not cause him to ignore reality. He understood that differences always exist between theory and practice. In the main, the doctrine of compassion was too simple to untangle the knotted threads of human motivation, which had already been complicated by the size of the bureaucracy and the wide span of our empire. The first grand-secretaiy labeled the professed moral tone of gov­ernment that enabled the bureaucrats to justify their lines of action the yang, and their hidden desires and motivations the yin. The mixing of yang with yin being a matter of degree, adherence to principle therefore varied not only from one person to another but from time to time within the same person.32 Not aiming at the impossible, Shen declared the goaI of his administration, if he could use that term, as “merely to provide something for the virtuous men to rely upon and the evil-minded to be afraid of. This in itself was a difficult task; it would be impracticable to set a higher standard.

One factor underlying the unmentioned desires and motivations was that to occupy an official position was regarded by the public as a profitable business,  even though most office-holders would deny it and almost none admit it. It was often reported that once a person passed his higher exami­nations and received his doctorate, he would be approached for many kinds of pecuniary purposes, including usury, land purchase, and allowing his public influence to be privately managed. Moneylenders in Peking offered selective loans to junior officials in the capital, expecting to make a hand­some profit when those officials were transferred to provincial posts. It was generally said that public finances were tight; but with a large amount of silver passing through his hands, an office-holder always found the means to benefit himself if he wished.33

The surrender to such temptations on the part of bureaucrats was also extremely uneven. While the majority would accept from sources of twilight legitimacy only what they considered to be a reasonable amount to supplement their nominal salaries and to keep up a standard of living in line with their station, there were also notorious characters whose family fortunes were a legend. Yet at the other end of the spectrum were a handful of rugged individuals who would not tolerate any infraction of the moral code. Their cause had recently been advanced by the eccentric model official, Hai Jui. This unevenness made central management most difficult, placing the bureaucracy in constant tension.

Shen Shih-hsing's task was not made easier by the networks of personal ties within the bureaucracy, which could be considered a necessary evil of the centralized administration. Fundamentally, to manage the affairs of an enormous empire from the center had many drawbacks. A severe handicap was that exact conditions at the operational level could never be ascertained. It took a whole month to deliver a report from a remote province to the capital, which might turn out to be the most splendid and ornately constructed prose ever written on the topic but at a time when the vital statistics of that district had not been revised for over a hundred years. Thus, with little exaggeration one could say that the administration was accumulating every sort of ambiguity and anomaly from the bottom up.

In the meantime the bureaucratic system had no way of making its established lines of responsibility more flexible. When something went awry in an official’s district he was discharged with it. It was not so much that he was adjudged legally guilty, as that administratively he had failed to maintain a flawless record—something that could not be overlooked. Even censorial investigation worked on this premise. If 3,000 brigands formed a war-band, some local officials had to be found at fault. They were charged either with failure to suppress the outlaws before the situation got out of hand or with the opposite: cruelty and ruthlessness in their attempts to deal summarily with the case, which then provoked the desperados into open revolt. Technically it would be too difficult to investigate more contributing factors and to trace responsibility to persons other than the immediately involved officials. Understandably, once such ”side issues" were admitted to the inquiry, the case could be argued endlessly, and the postponement of a settlement could paralyze the operation of the entire bureaucracy.

The standing procedure governing personnel evaluation of the Civil Service demanded that provincial and local officials report to the capital at three-year intervals, when their records were thoroughly scrutinized by the Ministry of Personnel and the censorial-supervising functionaries. Capital officials were evaluated once every six years. Individuals reached the end of their careers if on such  occasions they were labeled as ”cruel,” ”unstable,” “indiscreet” or similar descriptions. In the past a vigorous evaluation had resulted in as many as 2,000 officials receiving their orders of demotion, discharge, and retirement. Without purges of such dimensions the bureaucracy would be gutted. Yet such mass dismissals presented such a threat to the security of junior members of the service that they found it judicious to maintain close ties with their superiors. Persons from the same local district or those who had received degrees in the same year always felt a fraternal bond among themselves. The successful candidates, as a class, honored their examiners as mentors for a lifetime. Individuals who had already satisfactorily concluded their superior-subordinate relationship during one term of appointment would naturally continue this relationship on a personal basis when they encountered each other again in the course of assignment. There were also marital ties, of course, which linked many persons together beyond the scope of kinship. In this way patrons promoted their proteges, concealing their shortcomings and minimizing their mistakes. The latter, for their part, gave more devoted service to their benefactors, even to the extent of advancing their private interests.

From the vantage point of his experience, Shen Shih-hsing could see a dangerous tendency developing: the bureaucrats，instead of remaining a pool of civil servants ready to be assigned to the functionally divided departments and ministries, were establishing their own lines of communication and forming their own blocs. In part it was after viewing this situation that he designated the two kinds of motivation: the yin and the yang. Yet, being realistic, he never believed that all human frailty could or should be stamped out，having himself received the patronage of Chang Chii-cheng. As the emperor's chief counsellor, he saw that his urgent task was to help the young sovereign to reestablish public confidence，for mutual tolerance and mutual understanding were very much needed. He himself would do well to promote the yang rather than expose the yin. Committed to this purpose, every day he became more of a peacemaker than a policymaker.

One could always argue that the moral tone of government was a farce, or at most a facade the bureaucrats used to justify their lines of action. But there was no reason to believe that a facade had to be false, especially when men at the top were devoting their sincerity to maintaining it. The first grand-secretary had no alternative, because aside from morals, and aside from the common sense argued by the Four Books and Chu Hsi, there was no way to find a logical basis for and a working order behind our organization, to enable first the 2,000 capital oflficials, then the 20,000 members of the Civil Service and the one million aspirants for governmental offices, to say nothing of the numerous widowed mothers and foresighted grandparents, to arrive at a consensus—to decide what was right and what was wrong. Although private motivations were varied, indefinite, and uncertain—and in that respect no one person could speak of another for sure—moral laws were universally understood. They could be included in the emperor’s study sessions，engraved on tombstones，and passed on to posterity. This fact was more than adequately demonstrated by the case of Tsou Yiian-piao.

Tsou，having passed the Civil Service examinations in 1577 at the age of twenty-six, arrived in court just in time to submit his memorial impeaching Chang Chii-cheng for his failure to mourn his father’s death properly. For this bold move Tsou received eighty blows of the whipping club and was sent to the remote southwest as a common soldier, an exile that lasted for five years. In early 1583 he was recalled to Peking to become a supervising secretary, one of those wearing a hsieh-chih chest-badge. Since now remonstrance against the throne was part of his function, he lost no time in advising the Wan-li emperor to rid himself of many earthly desires and lead a pure and simple life. The imperial rescript on this paper, indicating that the counsel had been acknowledged, was as graceful as it could be under the circumstances. Not satisfied, however, Tsou returned with another memorial charging the throne with lack of faith. The implication was that Wan-li’s personal conduct made him unfit to be a ruler. In conclusion Tsou quoted the proverb，”The best way to keep your bad deeds from the knowledge of others is not to commit them in the first place.” This last sentence so infuriated the emperor that he was ready to give the memorialist a second beating at the Meridian Gate.35

Could a holder of rank 7b in the Civil Service, whose only recognizable merit was his earlier courageous impeachment of Chang Chii-cheng, be so brash as to set himself up as the spokesman of virtue and tell the throne what to do and what not to do, not even in a persuasive but in a commanding tone? Wan-li had his theory: being self-appointed authorities, Tsou and several others were by no means virtuous; neither were they loyal. What they were really after was instant fame. They were purchasing righteous names for themselves by paying the penalty of being disrespectful to him.36

The sovereign could very well have been right. Some bureaucrats, familiar with the classical pattern, had learned to live their lives in the light of history; for that the whipping club might not be too costly a price to pay. Yet, that being the case, it left the monarch and his first grand-secretary with even fewer alternatives: they too had to pursue a righteous name. Tsou Yiian-piao and his fellow remonstrators had proven that there was a universal standard venerated by learned men and sanctioned by history. Had a righteous name not been such a precious commodity, they would never have thought of buying it with their own flesh and blood in addition to their hard-won doctoral degrees and Civil Service ranks，not to mention the imperial commendations of their ancestors. This should have given the occupant of the throne and his cherished tutor something to think about. Unlike the junior officials, the emperor and his first grand-secretary were watched by the entire nation. Time, therefore, was not on their side and they could not afford to await the judgment of history.

When the first grand-secretary chose his role as peacemaker, his sincerity was appreciated by some but far from all the civil officials. He well knew that his critics were dissatisfied with his lack of resolution: ”His head is moving in one direction and his tail in another.” 37 At times he was also referred to as ”that clerk who used to take orders from Chang Chii-cheng.’’38 Occupying the desk left by Chang，Shen Shih-hsing was not entranced by these derogatory remarks, but neither was he seriously disturbed by them. Undoubtedly many others in his place would prefer to present themselves in a more decisive, dynamic，and authoritative manner. But as far as he could see, it had been exactly those heroic qualities that had brought down his predecessor. To follow Chang Chii-cheng's style at the top rung of the government would be to ignore the lesson of his failure.

As Shen Shih-hsing sat alone in the inner office of the Literary Depth Pavilion, he could almost hear his old mentor clearing his throat and issuing him instructions. Indeed, Chang had treated him more as a novice than as a partner. But this was the least of Shen’s complaints. Clerk or novice, his inferior position had actually allowed him to grow and to progress. He also had to acknowledge that his former superior and master had been a very talented man. More than anyone else, Chang Chii-cheng was capable of remembering thousands of things in minute detail. It was a shame that a man of such ability and with such a passion to serve the empire should go down in history as a failure. Although Shen Shih-hsing had no intention of dwelling on the shortcomings of others, still less those of his own benefactor, he knew the Chang Chii-cheng story well and had learned his lesson from it. Chang’s greatest fault had been that he could not practice humility, and because of that he tended to overlook the larger issues and in the end evolved into the kind of man Mencius had described as capable of seeing the barbs of a feather but unable to visualize a cartload of faggots.

This flaw was even more tragic because when Wan-li ascended the throne in 1572 Chang Chii-cheng was doing well. In those days no one was even gossiping about how he had maneuvered himself into becoming the master of the Literary Depth Pavilion and how he joined with Feng Pao to gain the empress dowager’s favor. Everybody was tired of the deceitful Kao Kung. Chang Chii-cheng seemed to be a much better choice.39 The events that followed had been unexpected; but in retrospect they were by no means incidental. In essence Chang Chii-cheng tried to impose a system on an organization the complexities of which could not be tidied up, and which, also by nature, had to operate under contradictory principles. He was bound sooner or later to meet opposition. He managed to chastise his critics in his lifetime; but his entire enterprise collapsed when he was dead and buried.

Chang was obsessed with the desire to improve governmental efficiency. He wanted a strong army, and in order to have one he had to fill up granaries and treasuries with food and silver. Financial administration was his area of specialization. But it was also in this area that he sowed the seeds of his own failure. The story is indeed complex.

Tax collection in our empire had numerous peculiarities. Anyone who was impatient with them could easily fall into their traps. Outwardly, the 1,100 counties were units on an equal footing. But appearance had little to do with reality. In practice, each county was assessed with a tax quota, which in most cases had not been revised for two hundred years. These quotas were extremely uneven: a rich county could turn out a total of tax proceeds several hundred times that of one of the poorest counties.

When a magistrate carefully scrutinized the affairs of the territory under his jurisdiction, he would to his surprise often find numerous unbelievable discrepancies between theory and practice. The native population, most of them illiterate, might use a set of units and measurements different from the official standard. Few of them understood governmental regulations aside from what they heard from their village elders. Many counties had not conducted a land survey for a long period, during which time land had been sold, rented, and mortgaged, and even the local topography had undergone changes. As a result, tax assessment might not correspond to actual holdings. In a number of cases it was difficult to determine who the legal owners were.

There were also many districts in which tax quotas were unusually low—so low, in fact, that at a glance one might wonder why the rates could not be increased. At least those districts should never have tax arrearages. But a more thorough investigation would disclose that because taxes were low, numerous small cultivators had acquired land of their own, yet their status as landowners by no means lifted them well above the starvation level. Large, rich, and absentee landlords all existed, but alongside them were also landlords who were just about as destitute as their own tenants. Essentially, the benefit of lower taxes had over a long time become indispensable to the livelihood of a significant segment of the population.

On the other hand，in a district where the tax quota was high，collection usually met with stiff resistance to a predictable degree，say about 60 percent in any particular county. In historical fact, the population in such districts habitually procrastinated about paying taxes，with the well-to-do landowners following the lead of marginal ones. They all knew that, up to a point, uncollected taxes would have to be written off, as no magistrate could struggle with thousands of delinquents forever. Chang Ghii-cheng must have heard the report that sometimes taxpayers hired paupers to answer summons on their behalf, so that when the latter were flogged by the magistrate for delinquency，the former could let their payments lag further behind.40 Shen Shih-hsing knew many such cases well, having come from Soochow himself，where tax collection had frustrated many a magistrate to the extent that Chang Chii-cheng called it “a demon’s country” and “a district that had no conscience.”41

The delivery of taxes to the higher offices was further handicapped by the practice on the part of many magistrates of collecting extras，called “customary fees，” most of which they appropriated to compensate themselves and to pay adminstrative expenses. Under normal circumstances these extras had to be covered before the proceeds were turned over.

When Chang Chii-cheng insisted that all districts make their tax payments in full, he actually put undue pressure on the Civil Service at its operational level. His critics refused to be impressed by the silver bullion that he accumulated at state treasuries. They contended that in order to fill the coffers the magistrates had had to arrest a large number of peasants and beat many of them to death. The charge could have been exaggerated, but the loss of good will was real. The administration had also thus contradicted the benevolent tone it had adopted for itself and abandoned indirect rule through the local gentry.

In his drive toward efficiency Chang had ignored the dual chracter of the bureaucracy. Indeed, generally speaking, the civil officials, all 20,000 of them, were jealous protectors of their own sinecures, patrons of their associates, and supporters of local landholding and usurious interests. Yet their professed adherence to the Four Books could never be totally discredited. When inspired, persons like Tsou Yiian-piao would sustain every hardship and act of injustice meted out to them in order to uphold what they considered to be fundamental principles. They did not even consider loyalty to the throne as an end. They felt free to criticize the emperor because they did not want to see their own loyalty to principle wasted; it was the emperor’s duty to translate that loyalty into action suitable to the doctrine of compassion. They could, of course, directly inspire others. It was this spirit which assured that the broken dikes on the Yellow River would be repaired, bandits suppressed, and barbarian invasions repulsed. In the officials’ eyes, Chang Chii-cheng was replacing this spirit of selflessness with his improvised efficiency control, and when that was not enough, by practicing favoritism among his cohorts.

In fact, Chang Chii-cheng’s partiality toward his close followers lay beyond his own choice. Fundamentally，the empire’s transportation and communication could never be sufficiently improved to be systematized. Thus with all the power he could muster, Chang could not alter the basic character of the empire. While he was in office, tax quotas in the provinces remained unrevised, no new agencies were created, the salary schedule was retained intact along with its unrealistic features, and the local governments still lacked service support. The persistence of these conditions demonstrated that no administrator, talented or not, could sacrifice the human touch to neat organizational principles.

Still, in the Literary Depth Pavilion Chang Chii-cheng worked hard. He reviewed fiscal accounts, checked the strength of the troops, and personally directed the arrest and retirement of high officials who had violated the law. He even designed report forms and set up deadlines. For a decade he promoted a new group of ministers and governors who were all very brisk to act and very innovative in their own spheres. But it would be naive to believe that they were always honest and incorruptible, since they too had achieved their prominence through all sorts of irregularities practiced from the bottom up.

Because of his lack of authority, Chang had to coach his trusted governors and commissioners to submit to the throne the kind of memorial he wanted，and then, as the emperor’s counsellor, he would approve the very recommendations he had worked out himself. Soon after he assumed office he found himself busily writing personal letters. To provide incentive, he included in his private correspondence to his followers suggestions for their career advancement. By exercising his grand-secretarial prerogative of appointing personnel in the name of the emperor, he thus created an institution of his own to compensate for the lack of system in the organization.

The case of Chang Chii-cheng fully exposed the weaknesses of the over-centralization of an enormous empire, whose technical problems exceeded its capacity to govern. There was a limit beyond which its administrative efficiency could not go, and to strive too hard in that direction could lead to peril. When the top administrator refused to accept this lower end of the efficiency scale as the standard, the bureaucrats became divided and technical problems turned into moral issues.

Inasmuch as Chang Chii-cheng had not abandoned the bureaucratic apparatus, he himself could not be consistent in his actions. What exposed him to the most criticism was his ostentatious style of living, which to his own way of thinking was no more than his due. It might have been justified under other circumstances. But in the present situation he was demanding from his fellow officials the kind of frugality that he himself did not practice. On one occasion, the unsuspecting emperor, hearing of Tutor Chang's intention of remodeling his house so that a new hall might be constructed to display the imperial calligraphy in his possession, directed that one thousand ounces of silver be contributed from his own purse to finance the project, as the sovereign assumed that his tutor must be a man of very limited means. Only years later did His Majesty learn that the actual cost of construction had run to ten times that amount.42 Moreover, the design of this Peking residence was immediately copied by the officials in Hukwang, who duplicated the mansion for Chang in his hometown using public funds. In spite of Chang's declining gesture, the same officials also erected three stone arches in his honor. Chang Chii-cheng also made an issue of the hostel services provided by the Imperial Postal System. He wanted to reserve them for only the most essential trips on official business and declared a stiff penalty for abuses. Yet his own household servants and those of his close relatives were seen in several provinces, demanding transportation and porter service from the local magistrates. His own letters disclosed that his followers often offered him valuable gifts, including land and cash.43

All these incidents forced Chang Chii-cheng's sympathizers into silence, although they wished to defend him. With his experience, he should have known that he could still pass unnoticed if he merely talked less about frugality and lived a life neither modest nor really extravagant. But Shen Shih-hsing’s predecessor had to be excessive on both counts. He made others uncomfortable as well as envious. Shen Shih-hsing could see that the charge of usurpation, if introduced alone, could easily have been dismissed, since technically Chang was obliged to assume responsibility when the emperor was still in his tender years. But when Chang Chii-cheng’s lack of sincerity was exposed in so many cases and emerged as a pattern, anything said about him was no longer inconceivable. One could imagine the emperor’s reaction to the news of many unpleasant details lately brought to his attention. As sovereign he had endured Chang’s sanctimonious preaching on frugality for years.

Aware of his own weaknesses, Chang Chii-cheng became increasingly sensitive to criticism. Perhaps that was why he was impelled to offend so many men of letters. If Shen Shih-hsing had one personal complaint against his patron and predecessor, it concerned the unnecessary insults Chang had hurled at these men of influence. Like all the bureaucrats, these literary figures also needed recorded official careers to boost their social esteem. Having already disqualified them as unfit for public service, Chang Chii-cheng could have spared them his caustic remarks, which served no purpose other than to aggravate their already wounded pride, and which caused Shen, in their eyes Chang's successor, to bear the consequences years later.

For example, Wang Shih-chen, the prose writer of the century, had considered himself Chang's “classmate,” as both men received their doctoral degrees in 1547. Denied a ministerial post, Wang made many overtures to the then first grand-secretary, writing eulogies of his parents and giving  him substantial gifts，including an antique piece of calligraphy. Chang was not moved, however. His answering letter to Wang expressed his opinion of him with a degree of candor that was not calculated to ease the tension between the two. In part it read: “A shield made in Wu and a curved saber manufactured in Yiieh should be encased in boxes and treasured，so that their fine quality will be kept intact. It would be unwise to take them out and use them; they would inevitably break.” The recipient of this letter endured his humiliation to publish a most derogatory biography of his controversial classmate，in which he also tossed a few uncomplimentary remarks Shen Shih-hsing’s way.

Another man of literary fame, Wang Tao-k'un, as vice minister of war had submitted an elegant essay transmitting his financial report. It is unclear whether his rhetorical extravagance or the discrepancies in his accounts annoyed Chang Chii-cheng more. He wrote Wang to inform him of his dismissal from the Civil Service, and why: ”Orchids, yes even orchids, would have to be weeded out, we regret to say, if they should ever bloom in the middle of public avenues.”45 In both these instances Chang merely saw the bureaucrats involved as individuals whom he might or might not select for government service. What he failed to see was that the bureaucracy as a body，representing the empire’s educated elite and long self-perpetuating, was a source of power in itself and, in a sense, was master.

In the last years of his life, Chang must have felt the mounting pressure of opposition, already intensified by the mourning issue in 1577. He began to see himself as a sort of martyr，to the point where he quoted Buddhist scripture to portray himself as “entering into the burning pyre in order to reach the gateway of soothing coolness.”46 Shen Shih-hsing，the novice, lacked his master’s zeal for martyrdom; yet he also knew that such dramatic self-sacrifice would not be necessary if he could avoid making most of the mistakes of his predecessor，which he was more than aware had been committed at the same desk he now occupied.


He remembered that in the early years of Wan-li’s reign，when the public placed great hope in Chang Chii-cheng, they did not expect him to take every item of governmental business into his own hands to create a system. Their concept of a superior statesman was one who could use his own personality and prestige to neutralize opposites. He should be firm and definite to a point; beyond that he must nevertheless let magnanimity and forgiveness take over，until men of varying talents all felt at home in the administration and the less virtuous and less competent would be inspired to do better. In sum, he should put the doctrine of sincerity to work. 

Unless one could dismiss all the bureaucrats or replace the present Civil Service with another organization founded on a different set of principles, one had to work with the bureaucracy as a whole on its own terms. It had a logic for its professed virtue; it also had an underlying urge for self-gain. It was essential to see its dual character and to read accurately the consensus of its members—not least the opinions of the men of letters among them. Since circumstances had already guided Shen Shih-hsing, the present first grand-secretary, to his self-assigned role of a peacemaker, he should carry on as such. What others called him made no great difference, even though he always respected their opinions.47

In 1587, the Year of the Pig, few people would have suspected that the present first grand-secretary had any reason to feel insecure. But this had not been the situation in the first two years after he took over the Literaiy Depth Pavilion. In those days anyone who had had the slightest connection with Chang Chii-cheng was under attack. It took more than good luck for Shen Shih-hsing to survive his share of crises，among them the case of Kao Ch’i-yii. The experience must have strengthened his belief in humility. He knew that without being humble he would never have remained where he was today.

Shen's quiet and peaceful disposition had been well accepted. But his emergence as the first grand-secretaiy could not have escaped criticism. His close relationship with Chang Chii-cheng was not something that every courtier was willing to forget. When in those days he felt uncertain about himself, even his status as the emperor's tutor gave him little assurance. Everyone could see that Wan-li was no longer the delightful pink-faced pupil always ready to comply and please. He had passed through a period of awkward adolescence. Now, with a thin mustache and a few whiskers on his round chin, he made it unmistakably clear that the boy who had been a manipulated ruler had now awakened to vindicate himself. This made the position of his chief counsellor even more hazardous.

Shen Shih-hsing’s apprehension was amply justified，both by the general atmosphere in the court and by the historical fact that of the eight first grand-secretaries who had preceded him, only two had completed their service without involving themselves or their family members in some criminal activities.48 Outwardly，the punitive action always came from the throne. In actuality, however, on none of the occasions had the prosecution been separable from controversies 	among the bureaucrats，and it had been traceable to policy differences thoroughly tainted with personality conflict and wounded pride. When a private feud was transformed into public issues over which the final verdict had to be given in terms of absolute good and evil, in not a single case had the emperor acted with full knowledge of the reality.

In those two very vulnerable years stretching from the summer of 1583 to the summer of 1585, Shen Shih-hsing could almost see a ring closing in around him. Only lack of positive evidence that the young emperor was ready to discharge his newly appointed first grand-secretary inhibited Shen’s adversaries from making an outright attack upon him. The “opposition,” represented by many angry young officials, wanted to know why, of Chang Chii-cheng's four sons, three had been awarded doctoral degrees and two appointed members of the Han-lin Academy. It so happened that on one of these occasions Shen Shih-hsing was the examiner for the Chang brothers. When this inquiry failed to remove Shen, a motion was introduced to bar sons of grand-secretaries from all future examinations. Al-though defeated, the proposal was calculated to draw attention to Shen Yung-mou，Shen Shih-hsing’s elder son. An impeachment of Minister of Personnel Yang Wei also failed to carry, although he was denounced in public for taking orders from the Literary Depth Pavilion when managing his office. The censure of the minister of rites by the same group of recalcitrants, on the other hand, did succeed. Hsii Hsiieh-mo was forced to retire. Ostensibly the ousted minister had not consulted enough of the geomantic specialists in the court before taking action, and as a result had selected an inferior site for the emperor’s future mausoleum. But the real issue concerning the bureaucrats here was that, like Shen Shih-hsing, Hsii was marked as Chang Chu-cheng's protege and had also recently married his daughter to Shen’s younger son.

The pattern was too familiar to be overlooked. The enemies of the first grand-secretary were stripping away the outer layers to reach the core. Charges were made by association and implication; technical errors were amplified into moral issues; isolated incidents were interpreted as a concerted effort. As always, a bureaucratic campaign could be started by a slogan, a couplet or pun, an anonymous handbill, an examination question, a suspected murder, the impeachment of an insignificant figure, or a memorandum on water supply or a report on horse-tails. The object was to draw attention and gather a following. Whether those purposes were achieved through straightforward argument or through subtle insinuation was not the point. Once the initial move was made, others would follow. The overall effect was cumulative. The early skirmishes generally engaged only the lower echelon of the bureaucracy; later the battle would be taken over by the senior members, who stood behind the more vociferous and sanguine young officials. A final showdown was deferred until the time was ripe. In politics, this was a way of life. The hidden motivation of the yin had to be mixed with and dignified by the more legitimate and justifiable yang, so that, without satisfying any specific legal technicality, the campaign would nevertheless go forward because public opinion was in its favor. All these strategies took time.

In the case of Kao Ch'i-yii, for instance, Grand-Secretary Shen Shih-hsing was brought to the brink of peril. Yet because he survived the crisis, his position was ultimately buttressed; his meekness proved to be, after all, a source of strength. Kao had established an enviable record as a Han-lin academician and had served in turn as chancellor of imperial universities in Nanking and Peking. Only recently, at Grand-Secretary Shen’s recommendation, was he given a vice minister’s title and appointed lecturer at the emperor’s public study sessions. If precedent counted as a reliable guide, one might assume that he was being groomed to be a future grandsecretary, or even eventually to become chief counsellor to the throne. But at this point fate dashed his hopes of reaching the summit of officialdom. Suddenly he was criticized for having handed out an examination question several years before, which, though asserting that the world belonged to the most talented and most virtuous, was actually a disguised message encouraging Chang Chii-cheng to usurp the throne, because at that time Chang was unabashedly posing as just such a superior character. This accusation had its serious implications. The charge was lethal: its shocking effect on the bewildered emperor was calculated, and the accused's association with the first grand-secretaiy was obvious. In an age when judiciary decisions depended more on logical deduction than on evidence, the accusers had reason to believe that they had handed over Shen Shih-hsing, along with the hapless Kao Ch’i-yu, to the vengeful-minded sovereign. As deliberation of the charges took place, Shen Shih-hsing, obviously involved, voluntarily suspended himself. When the second grand-secretary who was temporarily filling in pleaded on Shen’s behalf, he too was promptly censured by the young opposing courtiers, and had to stay home.49

At this point the emperor hesitated. But it must also have been at this point that he began to grasp the true meaning of all these belated efforts to “save” the throne. More decisively，the senior members of the court, whom the young officials had expected to act as their leaders, wanted no part of it. Wang Hsi-chiieh, the third grand-secretary, even argued in public that Shen  Shih-hsing’s mild and gentle manner should never be mistaken for a sign of weakness: it was statesmanship that held him back and made him so accommodating.

After a good deal of suspense the imperial decision was announced: Kao Ch’i-yii was dismissed from the Civil Service for handing out an “absurd” examination question. The imperial patent previously issued in honor of his ancestors was also withdrawn. The alleged usurpation, or the instigation for it, was, however, not questioned. As a mild way of showing disfavor to the accusers, the censor who had initiated the impeachment of Kao was not rewarded. Instead he was transferred to an obscure provincial post. Subsequently several agitators in the case were even demoted. However, the sovereign definitely wanted to retain the services of his two grand-secretaries. He dispatched eunuchs as his personal envoys to visit Shen Shih-hsing and Hsii Kuo at their residences and urged them to return to office.

Thus, in 1585, three years after his death, the case of Chang Chii-cheng was finally allowed to rest. Or at least when future controversies flared up in the court, the instigators had to find a justification different from exposing the lackeys of the deceased Grand Preceptor, whose title had already been rescinded and property confiscated.

Once the dust had settled, the first grand-secretary had the opportunity to reflect on the whole sequence of events. How many of his critics were genuinely concerned with the degrees conferred upon Chang’s sons and the inferiority or superiority of the emperor’s burial site? Possibly no more than a handful. There were some ambitious men who wanted to ride those controversies in order to move ahead. But again, those opportunists could not be many. The underlying fact was that Chang Chii-cheng had become an emotionally packed issue. Bare mention of his name could stir up antagonism, and one did not need to work very hard to arouse public anger toward persons labeled as Chang’s close associates, like Hsii Hsiieh-mo and himself.

Why was Chang Chii-cheng so universally hated? Though he had meant well，he had been off balance. By putting everyone under surveillance and dismissing individuals according to his own standards, he had threatened the security of thousands who wore embroidered chest-patches from cranes down to quails, thus directly and indirectly affecting their patrons and proteges as well. Above all, Chang had misunderstood the functions of those who wore the hsieh-chih monsters. Instead of deploying them to  imitate the Secret Police, he should have utilized the censors and supervising secretaries to assess public opinion. They should have been allowed to act according to public conscience after blending yin with yang.

For our empire an absolute standard was irrelevant. Peace and stability had to be derived from what the 20,000 degree holders wearing silk service robes considered fair and reasonable. When Chang Chii-cheng violated this principle, he threw the entire bureaucracy into a state of anxiety. Since most of the bureaucrats had arrived at their present stage of distinction through continued struggles aided by their families over generations, Chang, as his classmate Wang Shih-chen pointed out, had made himself a personal enemy of an entire empire.50 Without the resultant repressed anger and hidden fear, this anti-Chang movement could never have come such a long way, attracted so many followers, and generated the energy to produce so many incidents.

If—with luck—by the summer of 1585 the emperor’s decision had finally closed the case, Shen Shih-hsing was to make great efforts to ensure that such a disturbance would never occur again. He had already persuaded the Wan-li emperor to discontinue Chang Chii-cheng’s efficiency control as a first step toward easing tension among the civil officials. His methodically minded predecessor had devised a scheme of having supervising secretaries tabulate the tax arrears and cases of banditry reported in the counties and provinces. He had issued a directive that back taxes must be paid in full and all bandits caught. The central government summarized any unfinished business monthly and semiannually. Unless a magistrate was cleared by the supervising secretaries5 office, he could not be promoted or transferred. In some outstanding cases, officials were even called back from retirement to answer questions concerning undischarged responsibilities. This was totally unreasonable, Shen Shih-hsing argued. Tax collection involved so many factors that stood outside an official’s control that its success or failure should never be arbitrarily accepted as a measure of his compe-tence. Similarly, whether a bandit was caught or escaped was a matter of chance. The demand for total arrest only compelled magistrates to round up innocent suspects and torture them into confessing. These arguments alone eliminated the only institutional guide of Chang Chu-cheng's administration.51

To show his magnanimity, Shen Shih-hsing truly forgave the young officials who had moved to censure him, in several cases even recommending their promotions. His plea on behalf of Tsou Yiian-piao was especially unexpected, since Tsou, in addition to submitting outspoken memorials to infuriate the emperor, had also been instrumental in removing Minister of Rites Hsu Hsueh-mo, father of Shen’s own daughter-in-law. After considerable haggling on paper, he managed to secure Wan-li's permission to let the offending memorialist go without being beaten at the Meridian Gate. Yet no sooner had Tsou received his order of dismissal than the first grand-secretaiy started working on his second rehabilitation.

The spring of 1587 offered Shen Shih-hsing an even better opportunity to demonstrate his sincerity as a statesman, because in the Year of the Pig the evaluation of capital officials again fell due. Reversing his predecessor’s mass dismissals during the same event in the Year of the Snake, he was determined to limit the changes to an absolute minimum. Good feeling was generated when the word spread that the first grand-secretary wanted everyone to stay. When the final results were announced, only thirty-three doctoral-degree holders were demoted and discharged, and none from the three vital departments: the Ministry of Personnel, the entire censorial-supervising staff, and the Han-lin Academy. Such leniency was unprecedented. His own position now more than secure, Shen was generally regarded as an elder statesman, mellow and stable.52

Shen’s relationship with the sovereign also took a turn for the better. Cordiality had now progressed to a feeling of affection. As one of the envoys, he had, at His Majesty's command, conferred the title of Imperial Consort on Lady Cheng. He also made several trips to Ta-yii-shan to supervise the construction of the emperor’s mausoleum. This service pleased Wan-li so much that he authorized the first grand-secretary to wear on the site a special jacket with the double image of the character felicity embroidered on the front, which signified a commission unique in both color and design and possessing a distinguished personal touch.

With increased confidence, and using his native gifts of maneuvering and persuasion, Tutor Shen also obtained Wan-li’s consent to suspend his personal command of the army, to limit his travel outside the capital, and to restrain eunuch Chang Ching, who had taken over the Eastern Depot as head of the Secret Police. Although rarely mentioned, all these issues affected the sense of security of the civil officials. When a sensitive area was touched upon, their confrontation with the throne could be intense and bitter. Even though the bureaucrats never launched their protests by asserting their constitutional rights, the same effect was achieved when they submitted their humble pieces of advice and petitions telling the sovereign what he should never do. By foreseeing potential areas of contention and removing the causes beforehand, Shen Shih-hsing knew that he had fulfilled the role of a peacemaker.

But peacemaker or mellowed statesman，the first grand-secretary could never escape the criticism of being a great compromiser. What was the difference? A compromiser compromised. He abridged and discounted principles for the sake of expediency. Shen Shih-hsing could always argue that he needed to solidify his own position before he could put the emperor’s court once again in workable order. This argument was valid only up to a point—that is, provided that it produced results. He had correctly perceived Chang Chu-cheng's error as overconfidence in imposing order and discipline. In contrast，he preached in favor of sincerity，to be arrived at through ritualistic exercises and the exposition of classical literature.

The proposition was reasonable enough. There were, as everybody recognized, technical gaps in managing the affairs of a large empire; and experience had proven that these could not be bridged by ruthless demands imposed from above. Moral inspiration for voluntary striving to fill the gaps remained the only alternative. But Shen’s own record of four years as first grand-secretary could not convince his critics that the theory had been put into practice.

For one thing, he was now even unable to induce the emperor to attend ceremonial functions. Shen Shih-hsing must have been terrified at the realization that after the Chang Chii-cheng affair, with its charges and countercharges, His Majesty was growing more cynical every day. Yet how could he feel otherwise when, after years of taking Chang’s instructions as literally true, he found that everybody was saying one thing and doing another? He never openly resisted playing the role of paragon of virtue because it was required by the Four Books and the instructions of his ancestors. But how could one be sure that, sensitive as he was, inwardly he did not consider it a trap which the officials had laid for him? Now he also had the woman he loved, even though exactly what influence she had over him was not clear. All these factors taken together, however, in no way made Shen Shih-hsing’s position the slightest bit more defensible. After all, he was supposed to supply faith and guide the throne to perfection. As imperial tutor, he had lectured before the Wan-li emperor longer and more often than anyone else. In this hour, when he was mustering his maximum sincerity, would things begin to change? Or had he already exerted his maximum sincerity? Only time would tell.

Time Shen still had, but not as much as he thought. By 1587 he had reached the mid-point of his occupancy of the Literary Depth Pavilion. Only four more years would pass before he was to face the fact that time had run out for him, and suddenly he found that he could not stay even one day longer.
