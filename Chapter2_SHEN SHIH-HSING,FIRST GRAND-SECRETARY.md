For Shen Shih-hsing the moral burden was heavy every time he drew close to the Literary Floral Hall, a yellow-tiled building on the eastern side of the palace compound where the emperor held his private and public study sessions. It was there that one day in 1574 he had watched the Wan-Ii emperor, then ten years old, execute a sheet of calligraphy, Present Me to Goodness and Purify Me.1. The scroll was a message for Shen. He had been touched to receive a unique personal gift from the throne so preco­ciously and appropriately composed. Thirteen years later, Tutor Shen still had the imperial handwriting hanging in his residence; but now, alas, the early promise of a brilliant reign by Wan-li might never come to fruition.

Although Shen Shih-hsing was not one of the five instructors who had taught the crown his basic subjects, he had lectured before the emperor longer and more often than anyone else.4 Now, as first grand-secretary, he also had overall responsibility for the latter's study sessions, which is why the reigning monarch addressed him as "My Dear Tutor."11 Seldom did a whole month slip by without his receiving something from the throne as a reward for his service. These imperial gifts were sometimes tokens in the form of two samli, baskets of arbutus, folding fansf and branches of mugwort—articles of seasonal significance merely to remind the instructor that he was not forgotten on special occasions. But sometimes they could be quite substantial，consisting, for example, of pieces of silver and rolls of silk fabric in palace designs.3

Whether or not the gifts from the throne had financial value, it was the courtesy of the emperor that counted, with its implication of the recipient’s prestige and influence. Indeed, in these days to be appointed an emperor's instructor was a crucial turning point in a bureaucrat's career. Not everyone so appointed was destined to reach the highest office; but few of those who had not received the appointment could even hope to arrive at the top. To be a lecturer at the public sessions attended by the emperor himself especially attested a court official's unchallengeable erudition. He must be a highly qualified theoretician of statecraft if not a simultaneous practitioner of it.

By tradition the emperor's private study sessions started as soon as he was designated imperial heir, or when he reached six years old; at that time he was introduced to the Han-lin academicians. His public study sessions followed the enthronement and lasted throughout his reign. Held in the spring and autumn when the weather was comfortable, the public sessions took place three times a month. Attendance by all six ministers, two chief censors, all grand-secretaries, and other dignitaries, including the top aristocratic title-holders nominally on duty with the imperial army, was mandatory. The crowd was augmented by six supervising secretaries and cere­monial officials, all in their embroidered robes.

The session started very early in the morning, right after sunrise. To stress the solemnity of the occasion, the emperor arrived with twenty body- guards. Although not in armor as during other rituals, they carried their ceremonial weapons. First the sovereign took his seat in the study hall facing the doomay on the souths. At his command the assembly of officials entered the Literary Floral Gate. In the yard at the top of the granite staircase they kowtowed to the emperor. Only then were two lecterns car­ried in by the ceremonial officials and placed before the emperor, one just in front of him and the other facing it two steps away, for the lecturers. By this time the participating officials had filed into the buildings. According to rank and function, they flanked the path extending from the imperial seat to the doorway, including the lecterns.

Like all ceremonies, this one achieved audio and visual symmetry and balance. Each session was to begin with the exposition of selected verses from the Four Books, to be followed by a lecture based on another classical work, often historical. Two identical sets of textbooks, together with lecture notes neatly copied and submitted one day in advance for His Majesty's preview, had been placed on the lecterns. A volume of the Four Bookes was always on the sovereign's lefthand side. At the chanting of the master of ceremonies, two lecturers in red robes and two librarian assistants in dark blue, all Han-Iin academicians, broke from the ranks of lined-up officials to take their positions, the lecturers with backs to the doorway facing the emperor, the librarian assistants on two sides facing each other. Now the lecturers performed their own round of kowtowing. That done, the li­brarian assistant on the left came close to His Majesty's lectern and knelt. He turned to the exact page of the copy of Four Books and spread out his lecture notes. Simultaneously the lecturer on the left advanced one-and-a- half steps to the center and started his discussion. When he had finished, the copy of he Four Books was duly closed. The I wo performers retreated in good order to make way for their counterparts on the right. the entire proceedings occupied a good portion of the morning, through which the emperor, the only one seated, remained motionless and at attention. If he should inadvertently cross his legs, the lecturer was obligated to quote classical sources asking the question: Can the ruler himself neglect the principle of propriety? The question was repeated until it elicited a silent answer. The sovereign, awed by the reprimand, would revert to his original posture.

With all its ritualistic trappings, the lecture was a vital state institution. Though elucidating classical works, the lecturers were expected to relate their messages to the current affairs of the state. Not only were the dietums about the primary duties of the Son of Heaven, including his concern for the well-being of the people and the absolute importance of maintaining general moral standards, immediately applicable to the entire audience—not least the seated sovereign; but citing historical events was a way of compar­ing past with present, and thus of reiterating the close relationship between ethics and public well-being. A good lecturer must achieve this purpose. Imperial tutors who merely presented perfunctory lectures or used them to flatter the throne were considered disloyal and in some cases in the past had been dismissed.

When criticizing the emperor, the lecturer had, of course, to choose sub­tle approaches to make his inferences least offensive. The sovereign was entitled to ask questions and even to add comments of his own. But to challenge the speaker during the course of the lecture would have been a serious breach of decorum. Even if the instructor should go wrong because of poor preparation, imperial displeasure must be held back for the time being，to be expressed later at some opportune moment，and indirectly. This immunity of the lecturer had been observed even by Cheng-te, the present emperor's granduncle, who had broken many traditions but never this rule. Though he loathed the remarks on his personal conduct re­peatedly implied in the lectures, he nevertheless managed to maintain his forbearance. His only retaliatory measure took the form of sudden promo­tions of his most critical instructors to the remotest posts of the empire.

Now no longer a performer at the study sessions, Shen Shih-hsing was their planner and coordinator. His office of the Grand-Secretariat at the Literary Depth Pavilion was also located inside the Meridian Gate. How­ever, many interior gates and partitions separated it from the throne hall and the emperor's living quarters. On many working day the sovereign and his chief counsellor might not be more than a thousand yards away from each other, but it was the the longest thousand yards in the world. Aside frorm the morning audience and the study sessions, the emperor rarely saw his grand-Secretaries. Their intercommunications were conducted on paper, althoutgh sometimes imperial orders were relayed verbally by eunuchs. Very seldom did Wan-li summon a grand-secretary for consultation. When Shen Shih-hsing held the position, he was summoned on the average less than once a year. And the last time an emperor had visited the office of the Grand-Secretariat was 160 years earlier.

The Literary Depth Pavilion consisted of a main hall housing a statue of Confucius. It had four offices in addition to library facilities on the sides and in the attic. A bungalow across the yard provided working space for clerical assistants. As the nerve center of a large empire the layout was notably unassuming. But it had already been greatly improved from what it used to be during the earlier days of the dynasty when, in fact a "pavilion,"  it had served as little more than a place for the emperor's document officers to sit. The extension of office space, additional furnishings, and employment of clerical personnel marked the maturity of the secretariat. Only now it was not so clear whether the pavilion was a liaison office between the Civil Service and the throne, a command post over the ministries, merely an advisory body, or even an arbitrating agency. A great deal of its work could be described as the application of abstract principles to real problems. Often when, with the emperor's approval, it made a deci­sion about personnel management or something else, the published justification for the move possessed moral overtones which blurred the practical issues behind it. This departure from the true points at issue resulted from a lack of statutory guidance thal could deal with the legal technicalities of specific details. But the practice made public discussion of classical works even more vital, as they supported these moral overtones.7

Shen Shih-hsing had no reason to enjoy these public lessons any more than anyone else did. The sessions were much too long, the proceedings too formal. The themes chosen from classical sources had never been astoundingly interesting. To be on time for the assembly, he had to get up well before daybreak. Like all the other participants, before the middle of the session he felt tired and would be looking forward to the food and wine to be served in the reception room at the Left Concord Gate immediately afterward. But even this treat had to wait until the lecterns were removed, all the participants had filed in good order from the lecture hall，and had kowtowed once more to the emperor in the yard outside the building. At the gate room the banquet had been prepared in advance; yet it took a long time to seat everyone. The ranks and positions of the participants must be observed; nevertheless, exceptions were made for the lecturers, librarian assistants, and copyists who had duplicated the lecture notes, who took seats of higher honor over those of the same grade as themselves.

As the first grand-secretary, Shen Shih-hsing was personally responsible for maintaining the session in perfect order. He would feel disturbed if the Wan-li emperor showed signs of fatigue during the proceedings, a lecturer did not perform as well as expected, or something else went wrong with the ritual. By 1587, the Year of the Pig, he must have attended such lectures more than a hundred times, as prior to Wan-li's reign he had lectured in front of the Lung-ch'ing emperor. On the granite apron outside the Literary Floral Hall he had prostrated himself so often that he practically recognized its every stone. Not to mention the long hours of standing inside!

Sometimes Shen wondered why he had to be the one to argue that the study sessions must continue. Would not he，for his own sake，also love to be excused from the agonizing routine? The same thing applied to the emperors morning audience. Even Censor-in-Chief Keng Ting-hsiang, a vigorous man, confessed in one of his essays that he nad great difficulty during the predown event. It was worse on cold winter days. Like Keng, Shen Shih-hsing had originally come from the south where the weather was never like that of Peking. When，the previous winter, on a bitterly cold morning, he had overheard his colleagues saying that one man's white face had turned red and another's red face had turned black, he knew that his own admonition to carry on the audience proceedings would never make him popular.8

In 1587 Shen Shih-hsing was fifty-two years old. As he had pointed out in one of his memorials to the emperor, his hair and beard had already started to turn gray when he was still in his forties. As first grand-secretary, wearing a robe of the python design, he had also reached the highest rank of the Civil Service ladder.10 And then, there was the prior example of Chang Chii-cheng. Why not relax and take things as they come?

Relax indeed he could; he was never known as an impetuous man. But take things as they come he must not. In providing the best leadership to an empire such as ours, there was no substitute for ritualistic proceedings. The emperor did not have a formidable army at his command; he did not even have a large land base. He remained the Son of Heaven only because every­body believed that he was. This belief required the ritualistic exercises involving the sovereign and his chief ministers to be enacted with vigor and  regularity, completely in a public spirit, and accompanied by aesthetic and moral overtones. Pageantry or not, the many rounds ot kowtow reaffirmed  imperial supremacy; yet merely the fad that the emperor at­tended the ceremonies indicated that he was subjecting himself to the cosmic order and moral law. It was precisely because the messages taken  from  the basic classical sources were dull and trite that one must be pre­pared to listen to them again and again. The heat and cold and the predawn hour only tested the human will. This idea of discipline and endurance had been emphasized by Censor Keng. Even in the emperor's farming ritual obviously a degree of make-believe was involved; but make-believe is not necessarily unreal. One must realise how powerful an instrument of government it was when all the participants shared a belief in it. The emperor’s public study sessions symbolized an even more concrete meaning: the occupant of the throne and his best policymakers were seeking classical and historical guidance to arrive at an enlightened administration.

Thinking this way did not help Shen Shih-hsing to feel any easier, be­cause in 1587 there was little evidence that his tutorship over the emperor was a success. If it was, why had the twenty-four-year-old Wan-li emperor twice within the past twelve months declared that he had suffered from blackout when rising early in the morning and therefore had to have his audience with the court and the study sessions suspended for unspecified periods of time? Why had this happened both times in early autumn, when a new series of lectures had just gotten under way? More disturbing still was the fact that, though Wan-li had said he was unwell, the eunuchs revealed that His Majesty had been horseback-riding at the palace stable. He might even have been thrown from a horse and injured his forehead, which he did not want the courtiers to see.12 News of the incident had circulated widely, causing a secretary from the Ministy of Rites to remonstrate against the emperor for his negligence of duty and failure to take care of himself as the Son of Heaven. This fuss had hardly died down when in the early spring Wan-li again asked to be excused from public functions, this saying that，owing to an overabundance of the fire element in his body, he had taken some cooling medicine which, however, had driven the burning discomfort down to his feet，causing such unbearable itching that his resultant scratching had torn his skin. In the meantime stories persis­tently leaked out that the monarch was drinking to excess, was staying out loo late at night, and was overly involved with the palace ladies.13

There was little that Tutor Shen could do. With care he spread the stationery on his desk to compose a most persuasive memorial pleading with His Majesty, for the sake of the Imperial Shrine to take good care of himself. In it he nevertheless pointed out that the founder of the dynasty, the Hung-wu emperor, had carried on his public study sessions to the very end of his reign, by which time he was close to seventy. Would this message sway the young sovereign? The first grand-secretary was not sure.
